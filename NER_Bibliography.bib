abstract = {Restoration of functionally intact chromatin structure following DNA damage processing is crucial for maintaining genetic and epigenetic information in human cells. Here, we show the UV-induced uH2A foci formation in cells lacking XPC, DDB2, CSA or CSB, but not in cells lacking XPA, XPG or XPF indicating that uH2A incorporation relied on successful damage repair occurring through either GGR or TCR sub-pathway. In contrast, XPA, XPG or XPF were not required for formation of gammaH2AX foci in asynchronous cells. Notably, the H2A ubiquitin ligase Ring1B, a component of Polycomb repressor complex 1, did not localize at DNA damage sites. However, histone chaperone CAF-1 showed distinct localization to the damage sites. Knockdown of CAF-1 p60 abolished CAF-1 as well as uH2A foci formation. CAF-1 p150 was found to associate with NER factors TFIIH, RPA p70 and PCNA in chromatin. These data demonstrate that successful NER of genomic lesions and prompt CAF-1-mediated chromatin restoration link uH2A incorporation at the sites of damage repair within chromatin.},

abstract = {Accessibility within chromatin is an important factor in the prompt removal of UV-induced DNA damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Chromatin remodeling by the SWI/SNF complex has been shown to play an important modulating role in NER in vitro and yeast in vivo. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of cross-talk between SWI/SNF and NER in mammalian cells is not fully understood. Here, we show that knockdown of Brg1, the ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, negatively affects the elimination of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), but not of pyrimidine (6, 4)pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PP) following UV irradiation of mammalian cells. Brg1-deficient cells exhibit a lower chromatin relaxation as well as impaired recruitment of downstream NER factors, XPG and PCNA, to UV lesions. However, the assembly of upstream NER factors, DDB2 and XPC, at the damage site was unaffected by Brg1 knockdown. Interestingly, Brg1 interacts with XPC within chromatin and is recruited to UV-damaged sites in a DDB2- and XPC-dependent manner. Also, postirradiation decrease of XPC levels occurred more rapidly in Brg1-deficient than normal cells. Conversely, XPC transcription remained unaltered upon Brg1 knockdown indicating that Brg1 affects the stability of XPC protein following irradiation. Thus, Brg1 facilitates different stages of NER by initially modulating UV-induced chromatin relaxation and stabilizing XPC at the damage sites, and subsequently stimulating the recruitment of XPG and PCNA to successfully culminate the repair.},

To assess the role of p38 MAPK pathway in nucleotide excision repair (NER), the most versatile DNA repair pathway, we determined the efficiency of NER in cells treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and found that p38 MAPK is required for the prompt repair of UV-induced DNA damage CPD. We further investigated the possible mechanism through which p38 MAPK regulates NER and found that p38 MAPK mediates UV-induced histone H3 acetylation and chromatin relaxation. Moreover, p38 MAPK also regulates UV-induced DDB2 ubiquitylation and degradation via phosphorylation of the target protein. Finally, our results showed that p38 MAPK is required for the recruitment of NER factors XPC and TFIIH to UV-induced DNA damage sites. We conclude that p38 MAPK regulates chromatin remodeling as well as DDB2 degradation for facilitating NER factor assembly.},

abstract = {Virus infection of mammalian cells induces the production of high levels of type I interferons (IFN$\alpha$ and $\beta$), cytokines that orchestrate antiviral innate and adaptive immunity. Previous studies have shown that only a fraction of the infected cells produce IFN. However, the mechanisms responsible for this stochastic expression are poorly understood. Here we report an in depth analysis of IFN-expressing and non-expressing mouse cells infected with Sendai virus. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which an internal ribosome entry site/yellow fluorescent protein gene was inserted downstream from the endogenous IFN$\beta$ gene were used to distinguish between the two cell types, and they were isolated from each other using fluorescence-activated cell sorting methods. Analysis of the separated cells revealed that stochastic IFN$\beta$ expression is a consequence of cell-to-cell variability in the levels and/or activities of limiting components at every level of the virus induction process, ranging from viral replication and expression, to the sensing of viral RNA by host factors, to activation of the signaling pathway, to the levels of activated transcription factors. We propose that this highly complex stochastic IFN$\beta$ gene expression evolved to optimize both the level and distribution of type I IFNs in response to virus infection.},

Rearrangement of chromatin structure during nucleotide excision repair (NER) was discovered more than 2 decades ago. However, the molecular basis of chromatin dynamics during NER remains undefined. Pioneering studies in the field of gene transcription have shown that ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes play a critical role in chromatin dynamics during transcription. Similarly, recent studies have demonstrated that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex facilitates NER both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, histone acetylation has also been linked to the NER of ultraviolet light damage. In this article, we will discuss the role of these identified chromatin-modifying activities in NER.},

abstract = {The most prevalent DNA lesions induced by UVB are the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and the pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts ((6-4)PPs). It has been a long standing controversy as to which of these photoproduct is responsible for mutations in mammalian cells. Here we have introduced photoproduct-specific DNA photolyases into a mouse cell line carrying the transgenic mutation reporter genes lacI and cII. Exposure of the photolyase-expressing cell lines to photoreactivating light resulted in almost complete repair of either CPDs or (6-4)PPs within less than 3 h. The mutations produced by the remaining, nonrepaired photoproducts were scored. The mutant frequency in the cII gene after photoreactivation by CPD photolyase was reduced from 127 x 10(-5) to 34 x 10(-5) (background, 8-10 x 10(-5)). Photoreactivation with (6-4) photolyase did not lower the mutant frequency appreciably. In the lacI gene the mutant frequency after photoreactivation repair of CPDs was reduced from 148 x 10(-5) to 28 x 10(-5) (background, 6-10 x 10(-5)). Mutation spectra obtained with and without photoreactivation by CPD photolyase indicated that the remaining mutations were derived from background mutations, unrepaired CPDs, and other DNA photopoducts including perhaps a small contribution from (6-4)PPs. We conclude that CPDs are responsible for at least 80\% of the UVB-induced mutations in this mammalian cell model.},

abstract = {Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) constitute the most frequent UV-induced DNA photoproduct. However, it has remained unclear how human and other mammalian cells mitigate the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of CPDs emanating from their replicative bypass. Here, we examine in human cells the roles of translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) in the replicative bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer carried on the leading or the lagging strand DNA template in a plasmid system we have designed, and we determine in mouse cells the frequencies and mutational spectra generated from TLS occurring specifically opposite CPDs formed at TT, TC, and CC dipyrimidine sites. From these studies we draw the following conclusions: (i) TLS makes a very prominent contribution to CPD bypass on both the DNA strands during replication; (ii) Pols eta, kappa, and zeta provide alternate pathways for TLS opposite CPDs wherein Pols kappa and zeta promote mutagenic TLS opposite CPDs; and (iii) the absence of mutagenic TLS events opposite a cis-syn TT dimer in human cells and opposite CPDs formed at TT, TC, and CC sites in mouse cells that we observe upon the simultaneous knockdown of Pols kappa and zeta implicates a highly error-free role of Poleta in TLS opposite CPDs in mammalian cells. Such a remarkably high in vivo fidelity of Poleta could not have been anticipated in view of its low intrinsic fidelity. These observations have important bearing on how mammalian cells have adapted to avoid the mutagenic and carcinogenic consequences of exposure to sunlight.},

abstract = {The xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein complex XPC-HR23B was first
isolated as a factor that complemented nucleotide excision repair
defects of XP-C cell extracts in vitro. Recent studies have revealed
that this protein complex plays an important role in the early steps
of global genome nucleotide excision repair, especially in damage
recognition, open complex formation, and repair protein complex formation.
However, the precise function of XPC-HR23B in global genome repair
is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that XPC-HR23B interacts with
general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) both in vivo and in vitro.
This interaction is thought to be mediated through the specific affinity
of XPC for the TFIIH subunits XPB and/or p62, which are essential
for both basal transcription and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly,
association of TFIIH with DNA was observed in both wild-type and
XP-A cell extracts but not in XP-C cell extracts, and XPC-HR23B could
restore the association of TFIIH with DNA in XP-C cell extracts.
Moreover, we found that XPC-HR23B was necessary for efficient association
of TFIIH with damaged DNA in cell-free extracts. We conclude that
the XPC-HR23B protein complex plays a crucial role in the recruitment
of TFIIH to damaged DNA in global genome repair.},

abstract = {An adaptive response, low doses of a mutagen rendering cells more
able to subsequently cope with higher doses of that or a related
challenging mutagen, enhances nucleotide excision repair in human
fibroblasts. After fibroblasts were flashed with 20 J/m2 of UVC,
the cyclopyrimidine dimer frequency at any single dinucleotide position
remained unchanged for several hours before abruptly displaying first
order kinetics of repair. These kinetics were determined by ligation-mediated
PCR along exon 9 of the human p53 gene. When a chronic dose of quinacrine
mustard (QM) preceded the UVC challenge, the duration of the cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimer (CPD) repair lags were reduced by a factor of three
and the kinetic half-lives for CPD repair were reduced by a factor
of three. The observed repair kinetics are consistent with the following
model. The UVC dose required (K(m)) to generate a substrate concentration
which half-saturates the cell's repair capacity is 3 J/m2 for the
high affinity (6-4) photoproducts and greater than 100 J/m2 for the
low affinity cyclobutane dimers. After 20 J/m2 of UVC, the repair
enzyme is saturated with (6-4) photoproducts; these competitively
inhibit CPD repair by binding all available repair enzyme. After
the (6-4)s are repaired, the CPD concentration is less than K(m)(CPD)
and so CPD repair kinetics initiate with first order kinetics. QM-induced
enhancement, by increasing the concentration, Vmax, of repair enzyme,
shortens the duration of (6-4) saturation and increases the rate
constant for cyclobutane dimer repair. The data exactly fit the expectations
from Michaelis kinetics. Transcription coupled repair is less amenable
to Michaelis interpretations and enhanced global repair was almost
as rapid as the slightly enhanced transcription coupled repair. We
infer that repair enhancement is unable to proportionally increase
the number of matrix attachment sites necessary for transcription
coupled repair. Understanding competitive inhibition between adduct
classes and adaptive enhancement of Vmax is important to understanding
the effects of high doses of mutagen mixtures.},

abstract = {Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein plays an essential role in DNA damage recognition in mammalian global genome nucleotide excision repair (NER). Here, we analyze the functional basis of NER inactivation caused by a single amino acid substitution (Trp to Ser at position 690) in XPC, previously identified in the XPC patient XP13PV. The Trp690Ser change dramatically affects the in vivo stability of the XPC protein, thereby causing a significant reduction of its steady-state level in XP13PV fibroblasts. Despite normal heterotrimeric complex formation and physical interactions with other NER factors, the mutant XPC protein lacks binding affinity for both undamaged and damaged DNA. Thus, this single amino acid substitution is sufficient to compromise XPC function through both quantitative and qualitative alterations of the protein. Although the mutant XPC fails to recognize damaged DNA, it is still capable of accumulating in a UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB)-dependent manner to UV-damaged subnuclear domains.

As well as highlighting the importance of UV-DDB in recruiting XPC to UV-damaged sites, these findings demonstrate the role of DNA binding by XPC in the assembly of subsequent NER intermediate complexes.},

abstract = {Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutant known to cause DNA damage, which may be repaired through nucleotide excision repair (NER). However, little is known about dynamic changes in levels of DNA damage and their correlations with levels of NER proteins in cells exposed to BaP. In a series of experiments using the human bronchial epithelia cells (16HBE) exposed to different concentrations of BaP for different times, we measured dynamic changes in levels of DNA damage and expression of NER subunit xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) groups A, C, F, G (XPA, XPC, XPF, XPG) and excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), and analyzed their possible correlations. We found that in vitro exposure to BaP reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner ranging from 2 to 64microM and increased DNA damage in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Our results showed that levels of these NER proteins significantly increased and peaked at 12th or 24th, 8th or 12th and 4th or 8th hours in cells exposed to 2, 8 and 16microM BaP, respectively. ERCC1 expression increased by 2.4-, 4.2- and 19.3-fold for exposure to 2, 8 and 16microM BaP, respectively, compared with control group. Moreover, levels of ERCC1 in cells exposed 16microM BaP significantly higher than those in 2 and 8microM BaP from 2nd to 48th hours. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between Olive tail moments and relative ratios of ERCC1 in cells exposed to BaP. Our results suggested ERCC1 may be an important limiting factor for NER, but the mechanisms underlying this observation needs further investigation.},

abstract = {To assess the contribution to mutagenesis by human DNA repair defects,
a UV-treated shuttle vector plasmid, pZ189, was passed through fibroblasts
derived from Japanese xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients in two
different DNA repair complementation groups (A and F). Patients with
XP have clinical and cellular UV hypersensitivity, increased frequency
of skin cancer, and defects in DNA repair. The XP DNA repair defects
represented by complementation groups A (XP-A) and F (XP-F) are more
common in Japan than in Europe or the United States. In comparison
to results with DNA repair-proficient human cells (W138-VA13), UV-treated
pZ189 passed through the XP-A [XP2OS(SV)] or XP-F [XP2YO(SV)] cells
showed fewer surviving plasmids (XP-A less than XP-F) and a higher
frequency of mutated plasmids (XP-A greater than XP-F). Base sequence
analysis of more than 200 mutated plasmids showed the major type
of base substitution mutation to be the G:C----A:T transition with
all three cell lines. The XP-A and XP-F cells revealed a higher frequency
of G:C----A:T transitions and a lower frequency of transversions
among plasmids with single or tandem mutations and a lower frequency
of plasmids with multiple point mutations compared to the normal
line. The spectrum of mutations in pZ189 with the XP-A cells was
similar to that with the XP-F cells. Seventy-six to 91\% of the single
base substitution mutations occurred at G:C base pairs in which the
5'-neighboring base of the cytosine was thymine or cytosine. These
studies indicate that the DNA repair defects in Japanese XP patients
in complementation groups A and F result in different frequencies
of plasmid survival and mutagenesis but in similar types of mutagenic
abnormalities despite marked differences in clinical features. These
results, together with comparable studies from United States patients
in XP complementation groups A and D, suggest that G:C----A:T somatic
mutations may be important in the generation of human skin cancer
by UV radiation.},

abstract = {Brahma (Brm) and Brahma-related gene-1 (Brg1) ATPases share similarities in structure and function, but their presence in human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes is mutually exclusive. Although Brm and Brg1 can compensate for each other, it is possible that Brm and Brg1 have their unique properties to differentially regulate gene expression in vivo. To explore this, we examined the requirement of Brm and Brg1 for p53-dependent transcription, especially p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2, using cell lines in which Brm or Brg1 could be inducibly knocked down. We found that Brg1, but not Brm, is required for p21 induction in MCF7 cells. However, in Brg1-deficient H1299 cells, Brm is also required for p21 induction. Likewise, Brm is necessary for induction of p21 in MCF7 cells in which Brg1 is stably knocked down. In contrast, Brg1 has little, if any, effect on p53-mediated induction of MDM2 in cells that have Brm and vice versa. In addition, we demonstrated that the impaired induction of p21 upon Brg1 knockdown is at least in part due to decreased p53 binding to the p21 promoter. Taken together, we provided evidence that Brg1 is preferentially recruited by p53 for inducing a subset of target genes through chromatin remodeling. Thus, we hypothesize that the potential tumor suppressor function for Brg1 is mediated in part through the p53 pathway.},

abstract = {APOBEC3 proteins are cellular antiviral proteins that are targeted for proteasomal degradation by primate lentiviral Vif proteins. Vif acts as a substrate receptor for the Cullin5 (Cul5) E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically interacting with Cul5 through a novel H-(x5)-C-(x17-18)-C-(x3-5)-H zinc binding motif. Using the membrane-permeable zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), we demonstrated a requirement for zinc for Vif function in vivo. Treatment with TPEN at an IC50 of 1.79 microM inhibits Cul5 recruitment and APOBEC3G (A3G) degradation. Zinc chelation prevented Vif function in infectivity assays, allowing the virus to become sensitive to the antiviral activity of A3G. Zinc chelation had no effect on cellular Cul5-SOCS3 E3 ligase assembly, suggesting that zinc-dependent E3 ligase assembly may be unique to HIV-1 Vif, representing a new target for novel drug design.},

The local chromatin structure underlying promoters and hormone response elements is a major component involved in controlling these highly restricted expression patterns. Chromatin remodeling complexes, as well as histone and DNA modifying enzymes, are directed to gene-specific regions and create permissive or repressive chromatin environments. These structures further enable proper communication between transcription factors, co-regulators and basic transcription machinery. The regulatory elements active at target genes can be either constitutively accessible to receptors or subject to rapid receptor-dependent modification. The chromatin states responsible for these processes are in turn determined during development and differentiation. Thus access of regulatory factors to elements in chromatin provides a major level of cell selective regulation.},

In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the eukaryotic DNA damage tolerance pathway translesion synthesis (TLS), a process in which specialized DNA polymerases replicate across from DNA lesions. TLS aids in resistance to DNA damage, presumably by restarting stalled replication forks or filling in gaps that remain in the genome due to the presence of DNA lesions. One consequence of this process is the potential risk of introducing mutations. Given the role of these translesion polymerases in mutagenesis, we discuss the significant regulatory mechanisms that control the five known eukaryotic translesion polymerases: Rev1, Pol zeta, Pol kappa, Pol eta, and Pol iota.},

We examined the effect of the assembly of ultraviolet-irradiated plasmid DNA into nucleosomes on nucleotide excision repair supported by human cell extracts. Repair synthesis in unassembled UV-irradiated plasmid DNA was readily detected in extracts from repair-proficient human cells. In contrast, repair synthesis was markedly suppressed in UV-irradiated DNA assembled into nucleosomes (minichromosomes). This suppression occurred at a step(s) which precedes repair synthesis during nucleotide excision repair. Human cell extracts were unable to effectively assemble plasmid DNA into nucleosomes under repair synthesis conditions. The addition of purified histones to the extracts restored their capacity for nucleosome assembly and simultaneously led to the suppression of repair synthesis. We propose that the preferential repair of actively transcribed genes relative to transcriptionally silent genes may reflect altered nucleosome conformation during transcription.},

abstract = {Type 1 IFNs (IFN-alphabeta) play pivotal roles in the host antiviral response and in TLR-induced signaling. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-kappaB transcription factors are thought to be crucial for virus-induced mRNA expression of IFN-beta. Although recent studies have demonstrated essential roles for IRF3 and IRF7, the definitive role of NF-kappaB factors in IFN-beta (or IFN-alpha) expression remains unknown. Using mice deficient in distinct members of the NF-kappaB family, we investigated NF-kappaB function in regulating type 1 IFN expression in response to Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus infection. Surprisingly, IFN-beta and IFN-alpha expression was strongly induced following virus infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from p50(-/-), RelA/p65(-/-), cRel(-/-), p50(-/-)cRel(-/-), and p50(-/-)RelA(-/-) mice. Compared with wild-type MEFs, only RelA(-/-) and p50(-/-)RelA(-/-) MEFs showed a modest reduction in IFN-beta expression. To overcome functional redundancy between different NF-kappaB subunits, we expressed a dominant-negative IkappaBalpha protein in p50(-/-)RelA(-/-) MEFs to inhibit activation of remaining NF-kappaB subunits. Although viral infection of these cells failed to induce detectable NF-kappaB activity, both Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus infection led to robust IFN-beta expression. Virus infection of dendritic cells or TLR9-ligand CpG-D19 treatment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells from RelA(-/-) or p50(-/-)cRel(-/-) mice also induced robust type 1 IFN expression. Our findings therefore indicate that NF-kappaB subunits p50, RelA, and cRel play a relatively minor role in virus-induced type 1 IFN expression.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the major DNA repair process that removes diverse DNA lesions including UV-induced photoproducts. There are more than 20 proteins involved in NER. Among them, XPC is thought to be one of the first proteins to recognize DNA damage during global genomic repair (GGR), a sub-pathway of NER. In order to study the mechanism through which XPC participates in GGR, we investigated the possible modifications of XPC protein upon UV irradiation in mammalian cells. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from UV-irradiated normal human fibroblast, prepared by direct boiling in an SDS lysis buffer, showed several anti-XPC antibody-reactive bands with molecular weight higher than the original XPC protein. The reciprocal immunoprecipitation and siRNA transfection analysis demonstrated that XPC protein is modified by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin. By using several NER-deficient cell lines, we found that DDB2 and XPA are required for UV-induced XPC modifications. Interestingly, both the inactivation of ubiquitylation and the treatment of proteasome inhibitors quantitatively inhibited the UV-induced XPC modifications. Furthermore, XPC protein is degraded significantly following UV irradiation in XP-A cells in which sumoylation of XPC does not occur. Taken together, we conclude that XPC protein is modified by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin following UV irradiation and these modifications require the functions of DDB2 and XPA, as well as the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our results also suggest that at least one function of UV-induced XPC sumoylation is related to the stabilization of XPC protein.},

abstract = {The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is fundamental to synchronized continuation of many cellular processes, for example, cell-cycle progression, stress response, and cell differentiation. Recent studies have shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway functions in the regulation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in yeast. In order to investigate the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the NER of mammalian cells, global genomic repair (GGR), and transcription-coupled repair (TCR) were examined in a mouse ts20 cell line that harbors a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). We found that E1 inactivation-induced ubiquitination deficiency decreased both GGR and TCR, indicating that the ubiquitination system is involved in the optimization of entire NER machinery in mammalian cells. We specifically inhibited the function of 19S proteasome subunit by overexpressing 19S regulatory complex hSug1 or its mutant protein hSug1mk in repair competent human fibroblast, OSU-2, cells and compared their capacity for NER. The results showed that 19S regulatory complex positively modulates NER in cells. In addition, we treated OSU-2 cells with the inhibitors of 20S subunit function, MG132 and lactacystin, and demonstrated that the catalytic activity of 20S subunit is also required for efficient NER. Moreover, the UV-induced recruitment of repair factor xeroderma pigmentosum protein C (XPC) to damage sites was negatively affected by treatment of repair competent cells with MG132. Taken together, we conclude that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has a positive regulatory role for optimal NER capacity in mammalian cells and appears to act through facilitating the recruitment of repair factors to DNA damage sites.},

abstract = {The Xeroderma Pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein is indispensable to global genomic repair (GGR), a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER), and plays an important role in the initial damage recognition. XPC can be modified by both ubiquitin and SUMO in response to UV irradiation of cells. Here, we show that XPC undergoes degradation upon UV irradiation, and this is independent of protein ubiquitylation. The subunits of DDB-Cul4A E3 ligase differentially regulate UV-induced XPC degradation, e.g DDB2 is required and promotes, whereas DDB1 and Cul4A protect the protein degradation. Mutation of XPC K655 to alanine abolishes both UV-induced XPC modification and degradation. XPC degradation is necessary for recruiting XPG and efficient NER. The overall results provide crucial insights regarding the fate and role of XPC protein in the initiation of excision repair.},

abstract = {Human excision nuclease removes DNA damage by concerted dual incisions
bracketing the lesion. The dual incisions are accomplished by sequential
and partly overlapping actions of six repair factors, RPA, XPA, XPC,
TFIIH, XPG, and XPF.ERCC1. Of these, RPA, XPA, and XPC have specific
binding affinity for damaged DNA. To learn about the role of these
three proteins in damage recognition and the order of assembly of
the excision nuclease, we measured the binding affinities of XPA,
RPA, and XPC to a DNA fragment containing a single (6-4) photoproduct
and determined the rate of damage excision under a variety of reaction
conditions. We found that XPC has the highest affinity to DNA and
that RPA has the highest selectivity for damaged DNA. Under experimental
conditions conducive to binding of either XPA + RPA or XPC to damaged
DNA, the rate of damage removal was about 5-fold faster for reactions
in which XPA + RPA was the first damage recognition factor presented
to DNA compared with reactions in which XPC was the first protein
that had the opportunity to bind to DNA. We conclude that RPA and
XPA are the initial damage sensing factors of human excision nuclease.},

the 3'-incision in the human dual incision (excision nuclease) repair

repair, we mutagenized two amino acid residues thought to be involved
in DNA binding and catalysis, overproduced the mutant proteins using
a baculovirus/insect cell system, and purified and characterized
the mutant proteins. The mutation D77A had a modest effect on junction
cutting and excision activity and gave rise to uncoupled 5'-incision
by mammalian cell-free extracts. The D812A mutation completely abolished
the junction cutting and 3'-incision activities of XPG, but the excision
nuclease reconstituted with XPG (D812A) carried out normal 5'-incision
at the 23rd-24th phosphodiester bonds 5' to a (6-4) photoproduct
without producing any 3'-incision. It is concluded that Asp-812 is
an active site residue of XPG and that in addition to making the
3'-incision, the physical presence of XPG in the protein-DNA complex
is required non-catalytically for subsequent 5'-incision by XPF-ERCC1.},

abstract = {The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), like other eukaryotic transcription factors, regulates gene expression by interacting with chromatinized DNA response elements. Photobleaching experiments in living cells indicate that receptors transiently interact with DNA on the time scale of seconds and predict that the response elements may be sparsely occupied on average. Here, we show that the binding of one receptor at the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) does not reduce the steady-state binding of another receptor variant to the same GRE. Mathematical simulations reproduce this noncompetitive state using short GR/GRE residency times and relatively long times between DNA binding events. At many genomic sites where GR binding causes increased chromatin accessibility, concurrent steady-state binding levels for the variant receptor are actually increased, a phenomenon termed assisted loading. Temporally sparse transcription factor-DNA interactions induce local chromatin reorganization, resulting in transient access for binding of secondary regulatory factors.},

nucleotide excision repair (NER) defect of xeroderma pigmentosum
(XP) complementation group B. In addition to its function in NER,
the ERCC3 DNA helicase was recently identified as one of the components
of the human BTF2/TFIIH transcription factor complex, which is required
for initiation of transcription of class II genes. To date, a single
patient (XP11BE) has been assigned to this XP group B (XP-B), with
ther remarkable conjunction of two autosomal recessive DNA repair
deficiency disorders: XP and Cockayne syndrome (CS). The intriguing
involvement of the ERCC3 protein in the vital process of transcription
may provide an explanation for the rarity, severity, and wide spectrum
of clinical features in this complementation group. Here we report
the identification of two new XP-B patients: XPCS1BA and XPCS2BA
(siblings), by microneedle injection of the cloned ERCC3 repair gene
as well as by cell hybridization. Molecular analysis of the ERCC3
gene in both patients revealed a single base substitution causing
a missense mutation in a region that is completely conserved in yeast,
Drosophila, mouse, and human ERCC3. As in patient XP11BE, the expression
of only one allele (paternal) is detected. The mutation causes a
virtually complete inactivation of the NER function of the protein.
Despite this severe NER defect, both patients display a late onset
of neurologic impairment, mild cutaneous symptoms, and a striking
absence of skin tumors even at an age of > 40 years. Analysis of
the frequency of hprt- mutant T-lymphocytes in blood samples suggests
a relatively low in vivo mutation frequency in these patients. Factors
in addition to NER deficiency may be required for the development
of cutaneous tumors.},

abstract = {Transcription regulation in eukaryotes involves rapid recruitment and proper assembly of transcription factors at gene promoters. To determine the dynamics of the transcription machinery on DNA, we used a differential chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure coupled to whole-genome microarray detection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that TATA-binding protein (TBP) turnover is low at RNA polymerase I (Pol I) promoters. Whereas RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoters represent an intermediate case, TBP turnover is high at RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoters. Within these promoters, the highest turnover correlates with binding of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex (SAGA) coactivator, Mot1p dependence and presence of a canonical TATA box. In contrast, slow turnover Pol II promoters depend on TFIID and on the gene-specific factor, Rap1p. Together this shows that TBP turnover is regulated by protein factors rather than DNA sequence and argues that TBP turnover is an important determinant in regulating gene expression.},

Since the sensitivity of this assay is limited to the size of the DNA amplification fragment, conditions have been found for the quantitative generation of PCR fragments from human genomic DNA in the range of 6-24 kb in length. These fragments include: (1) a 16.2 kb product from the mitochondrial genome; (2) 6.2, 10.4 kb, and 15.4 kb products from the hprt gene, and (3) 13.5, 17.7, 24.2 kb products from the human beta-globin gene cluster. Exposure of SV40 transformed human fibroblasts to increasing fluences of ultraviolet light (UV) resulted in the linear production of photoproducts with 10 J/m(2) of UVC producing 0.085 and 0.079 lesions/kb in the hprt gene and the beta-globin gene cluster, respectively. Kinetic analysis of repair following 10 J/m(2) of UVC exposure indicated that the time necessary for the removal of 50\% of the photoproducts, in the hprt gene and beta-globin gene cluster was 7.8 and 24.2 h, respectively. Studies using lymphoblastoid cell lines show very little repair in XPA cells in both the hprt gene and beta-globin locus. Preferential repair in the hprt gene was detected in XPC cells. Cisplatin lesions were also detected using this method and showed slower rates of repair than UV-induced photoproducts. These data indicate that the use of long targets in the gene-specific QPCR assay allows the measurement of biologically relevant lesion frequencies in 5-30 ng of genomic DNA. This assay will be useful for the measurement of human exposure to genotoxic agents and the determination of human repair capacity.},

abstract = {We investigated the contribution of the global and the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathway to the removal of structurally different DNA lesions. The repair kinetics of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs) were determined in an active and inactive gene in normal human fibroblasts and in xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XP-C) fibroblasts. Previously we have shown that in normal human cells exposed to a UV dose of 10 J/m2 repair of CPDs takes place via two pathways: global repair and transcription-coupled repair, the latter being responsible for accelerated repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand of active genes. So far, no clear evidence for transcription-coupled repair of 6-4PPs has been presented. Here we demonstrate that 6-4PPs really form a target for transcription-coupled repair. In XP-C cells, exposed to 30 J/m2 and only capable of performing transcription-coupled repair, CPDs as well as 6-4PPs are removed selectively and with similar kinetics from the transcribed strand of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. The non-transcribed strand of the ADA gene and the inactive 754 gene are hardly repaired. In contrast to XP-C cells, normal cells exposed to 30 J/m2 lack strand-specific repair of both 6-4PPs and CPDs, suggesting that transcription-coupled repair is overruled by global repair, probably due to severe inhibition of transcription at this high UV dose. The much more rapid repair of 6-4PPs compared with CPDs in normal cells may be related to higher affinity of the global repair system for the former lesion. In XP-C cells the similarity of the rate of repair of both 6-4PPs and CPDs in the transcribed strand at 30 J/m2 indicates that transcription-coupled repair of photolesions takes place in a sequential way. Our results strongly suggest that the significance of transcription-coupled repair for removal of lesions depends on the type of lesion and on the dose employed.},

abstract = {The xeroderma pigmentosum syndrome complementation group C (XP-C) is due to a defect in the global genome repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER). The XPC protein is complexed with HHR23B, one of the two human homologs of the yeast NER protein, RAD23 (Masutani at al. (1994) EMBO J. 8, 1831-1843). Using heparin chromatography, gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis we demonstrate that the majority of HHR23B is in a free, non-complexed form, and that a minor fraction is tightly associated with XPC. In contrast, we cannot detect any bound HHR23A. Thus the HHR23 proteins may have an additional function independent of XPC. The fractionation behaviour suggests that the non-bound forms of the HHR23 proteins are not necessary for the core of the NER reaction. Although both HHR23 proteins share a high level of overall homology, they migrate very differently on native gels, pointing to a difference in conformation. Gel filtration suggests the XPC-HHR23B heterodimer resides in a high MW complex. However, immunodepletion studies starting from repair-competent Manley extracts fall to reveal a stable association of a significant fraction of the HHR23 proteins or the XPC-HHR23B complex with the basal transcription/repair factor TFIIH, or with the ERCC1 repair complex. Consistent with a function in repair or DNA/chromatin metabolism, immunofluorescence studies show all XPC, HHR23B and (the free) HHR23A to reside in the nucleus.},

abstract = {To investigate the relationship between chromatin dynamics and nucleotide excision repair (NER), we have examined the effect of chromatin structure on the formation of two major classes of UV-induced DNA lesions in reconstituted dinucleosomes. Furthermore, we have developed a model chromatin-NER system consisting of purified human NER factors and dinucleosome substrates that contain pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs) either at the center of the nucleosome or in the linker DNA. We have found that the two classes of UV-induced DNA lesions are formed efficiently at every location on dinucleosomes in a manner similar to that of naked DNA, even in the presence of histone H1. On the other hand, excision of 6-4PPs is strongly inhibited by dinucleosome assembly, even within the linker DNA region. These results provide direct evidence that the human NER machinery requires a space greater than the size of the linker DNA to excise UV lesions efficiently. Interestingly, NER dual incision in dinucleosomes is facilitated by recombinant ACF, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor. Our results indicate that there is a functional connection between chromatin remodeling and the initiation step of NER.},

abstract = {Cellular DNA damage is reversed by balanced repair pathways that avoid accumulation of toxic intermediates. Despite their importance, the organization of DNA repair pathways and the function of repair enzymes in vivo have remained unclear because of the inability to directly observe individual reactions in living cells. Here, we used photoactivation, localization, and tracking in live Escherichia coli to directly visualize single fluorescent labeled DNA polymerase I (Pol) and ligase (Lig) molecules searching for DNA gaps and nicks, performing transient reactions, and releasing their products. Our general approach provides enzymatic rates and copy numbers, substrate-search times, diffusion characteristics, and the spatial distribution of reaction sites, at the single-cell level, all in one measurement. Single repair events last 2.1 s (Pol) and 2.5 s (Lig), respectively. Pol and Lig activities increased fivefold over the basal level within minutes of DNA methylation damage; their rates were limited by upstream base excision repair pathway steps. Pol and Lig spent >80\% of their time searching for free substrates, thereby minimizing both the number and lifetime of toxic repair intermediates. We integrated these single-molecule observations to generate a quantitative, systems-level description of a model repair pathway in vivo.},

We now report that HMGN3, a nuclear protein that binds to nucleosomes and affects chromatin function, is highly expressed in beta cells and that in mice, loss of HMGN3 impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and leads to a diabetic phenotype. In pancreatic beta cells, loss of HMGN3 affects the transcription of several genes involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, including that of the Glut2 glucose transporter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that HMGN3 and the transcription factor PDX1 mutually reinforce their specific binding to the chromatin in the promoter of the Glut2 gene, thereby regulating GLUT2 protein levels in pancreatic islets and in beta cells. Our results identify a new regulator of glucose homeostasis and demonstrate a link between the activity of a nucleosome binding structural protein and the regulation of insulin secretion.},

Correlations have been drawn between gene silencing and proximity to a heterochromatic compartment. At the other end of the scale are ribosomal genes, which are transcribed at a very high rate by RNA polymerase I (\~{}60\% of total transcription), have a loose chromatin structure, and are clustered in the nucleolus. The rDNA sequences have 2 distinct structures: active rRNA genes, which have no nucleosomes; and inactive rRNA genes, which have nucleosomes. Like DNA transcription and replication, DNA repair is modulated by the structure of chromatin, and the kinetics of DNA repair vary among the nuclear domains. Although research on DNA repair in all chromosomal contexts is important to understand the mechanisms of genome maintenance, this review focuses on nucleotide excision repair and photolyase repair of UV photoproducts in the first-order packing of DNA in chromatin: the nucleosome. In addition, it summarizes the studies that have demonstrated the existence of the 2 rDNA chromatins, and the way this feature of the rDNA locus allows for direct comparison of DNA repair in 2 very different structures: nucleosome and non-nucleosome DNA.},

The globally increased histone acetylation caused a reversible decondensation of dense chromatin regions and led to a more homogeneous distribution. These structural changes were quantified by image correlation spectroscopy and by spatially resolved scaling analysis. The image analysis revealed that a chromatin reorganization on a length scale from 200 nm to >1 microm was induced consistent with the opening of condensed chromatin domains containing several Mb of DNA. The observed conformation changes could be assigned to the folding of chromatin during G1 phase by characterizing the effect of TSA on cell cycle progression and developing a protocol that allowed the identification of G1 phase cells on microscope coverslips. An analysis by flow cytometry showed that the addition of TSA led to a significant arrest of cells in S phase and induced apoptosis. The concentration dependence of both processes was studied.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, the core promoter serves as a platform for the assembly of transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) that includes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II (pol II), which function collectively to specify the transcription start site. PIC formation usually begins with TFIID binding to the TATA box, initiator, and/or downstream promoter element (DPE) found in most core promoters, followed by the entry of other general transcription factors (GTFs) and pol II through either a sequential assembly or a preassembled pol II holoenzyme pathway. Formation of this promoter-bound complex is sufficient for a basal level of transcription. However, for activator-dependent (or regulated) transcription, general cofactors are often required to transmit regulatory signals between gene-specific activators and the general transcription machinery. Three classes of general cofactors, including TBP-associated factors (TAFs), Mediator, and upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived positive cofactors (PC1/PARP-1, PC2, PC3/DNA topoisomerase I, and PC4) and negative cofactor 1 (NC1/HMGB1), normally function independently or in combination to fine-tune the promoter activity in a gene-specific or cell-type-specific manner. In addition, other cofactors, such as TAF1, BTAF1, and negative cofactor 2 (NC2), can also modulate TBP or TFIID binding to the core promoter. In general, these cofactors are capable of repressing basal transcription when activators are absent and stimulating transcription in the presence of activators. Here we review the roles of these cofactors and GTFs, as well as TBP-related factors (TRFs), TAF-containing complexes (TFTC, SAGA, SLIK/SALSA, STAGA, and PRC1) and TAF variants, in pol II-mediated transcription, with emphasis on the events occurring after the chromatin has been remodeled but prior to the formation of the first phosphodiester bond.},

The initial sensing of infection is mediated by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors. The intracellular signaling cascades triggered by these PRRs lead to transcriptional expression of inflammatory mediators that coordinate the elimination of pathogens and infected cells. However, aberrant activation of this system leads to immunodeficiency, septic shock, or induction of autoimmunity. In this Review, we discuss the role of PRRs, their signaling pathways, and how they control inflammatory responses.},

Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase activity of the DDB2 complex is required for efficient global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) in chromatin. Mutant DDB2 proteins derived from xeroderma pigmentosum group E patients are not able to mediate ubiquitylation around damaged sites in chromatin. We also found that CSN, a negative regulator of cullin-based ubiquitin ligases, dissociates from the DDB2 complex when the complex binds to damaged DNA and that XPC and Ku oppositely regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity, especially around damaged sites. Furthermore, the DDB2 complex-mediated ubiquitylation plays a role in recruiting XPA to damaged sites. These findings shed some light on the early stages of GG-NER.},

We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

we identified XPC-HR23B as the earliest damage detector to initiate

the first NER stages, and suggest a two-step mechanism of damage

verification by XPA. This provides a plausible explanation for the
extreme damage specificity exhibited by global genome repair. In
analogy, in the transcription-coupled NER subpathway, RNA polymerase
II may take the role of XPC. After this subpathway-specific initial
lesion detection, XPA may function as a common damage verifier and
adaptor to the core of the NER apparatus.},

abstract = {The xeroderma pigmentosum group E gene product DDB2, a protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), associates with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex Cul4A-DDB1. But the precise role of these interactions in the NER activity of DDB2 is unclear. Several models, including DDB2-mediated ubiquitination of histones in UV-irradiated cells, have been proposed. But those models lack clear genetic evidence. Here we show that DDB2 participates in NER by regulating the cellular levels of p21(Waf1/Cip1). We show that DDB2 enhances nuclear accumulation of DDB1, which binds to a modified form of p53 containing phosphorylation at Ser18 (p53(S18P)) and targets it for degradation in low-dose-UV-irradiated cells. DDB2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), unlike wild-type MEFs, are deficient in the proteolysis of p53(S18P). Accumulation of p53(S18P) in DDB2(-/-) MEFs causes higher expression p21(Waf1/Cip1). We show that the increased expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) is the cause NER deficiency in DDB2(-/-) cells because deletion or knockdown of p21(Waf1/Cip1) reverses their NER-deficient phenotype. p21(Waf1/Cip1) was shown to bind PCNA, which is required for both DNA replication and NER. Moreover, an increased level of p21(Waf1/Cip1) was shown to inhibit NER both in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide genetic evidence linking the regulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) to the NER activity of DDB2.},

abstract = {Transcription, replication and homologous recombination are intrinsically connected and it is well established that an increase of transcription is associated with an increase in homologous recombination. Here, we have studied how homologous recombination is affected during transcription inhibition by 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a compound that prevents activating phosphorylations of the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain. We identify that DRB triggers an increase in homologous recombination within the hprt gene as well as increasing RAD51 foci formation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we find that DRB-induced transcriptional stress is associated with formation of the nuclear foci of the phosphorylated form of H2AX ($\gamma$H2AX). We accounted that about 72\% of RAD51 foci co-localized with the observed $\gamma$H2AX foci. Interestingly, we find that XRCC3 mutated, homologous recombination defective cells are hypersensitive to the toxic effect of DRB and fail to form RAD51 foci. In conclusion, we show that DRB-induced transcription inhibition is associated with the formation of a lesion that triggers RAD51-dependent homologous recombination repair, required for survival under transcriptional stress.},

Even if an initial response occurs, acquired resistance due to mutations and epigenetic events limits efficacy. Resistance may be due to excess of a resistance factor, to saturation of factors required for tumor cell killing, or to mutation or alteration of a factor required for tumor cell killing. Platinum resistance could arise from decreased tumor blood flow, extracellular conditions, reduced platinum uptake, increased efflux, intracellular detoxification by glutathione, etc., decreased binding (e.g., due to high intracellular pH), DNA repair, decreased mismatch repair, defective apoptosis, antiapoptotic factors, effects of several signaling pathways, or presence of quiescent non-cycling cells. In lung cancer, flattening of dose-response curves at higher doses suggests that efficacy is limited by exhaustion of something required for cell killing, and several clinical observations suggest epigenetic events may play a major role in resistance.},

The former model favors a stable transcription complex with subunits that cooperatively assemble in order, whereas the latter model favors an unstable complex with subunits that may assemble more randomly. To confront this apparent discrepancy, we review the merits and drawbacks of the different experimental approaches and list potential biasing factors that could be responsible for the different interpretations of assembly. We then discuss how these biases might be overcome in the future with improved experiments or new techniques.

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) requires the coordinated sequential assembly and actions of the involved proteins at sites of DNA damage. Following damage recognition, dual incision 5' to the lesion by ERCC1-XPF and 3' to the lesion by XPG leads to the removal of a lesion-containing oligonucleotide of about 30 nucleotides. The resulting single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap on the undamaged strand is filled in by DNA repair synthesis. Here, we have asked how dual incision and repair synthesis are coordinated in human cells to avoid the exposure of potentially harmful ssDNA intermediates. Using catalytically inactive mutants of ERCC1-XPF and XPG, we show that the 5' incision by ERCC1-XPF precedes the 3' incision by XPG and that the initiation of repair synthesis does not require the catalytic activity of XPG. We propose that a defined order of dual incision and repair synthesis exists in human cells in the form of a 'cut-patch-cut-patch' mechanism. This mechanism may aid the smooth progression through the NER pathway and contribute to genome integrity.},

abstract = {Accurate DNA replication requires proper regulation of replication licensing, which entails loading MCM-2-7 onto replication origins. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive view of replication licensing in vivo, using video microscopy of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. As expected, MCM-2-7 loading in late M phase depended on the prereplicative complex (pre-RC) proteins: origin recognition complex (ORC), CDC-6, and CDT-1. However, many features we observed have not been described before: GFP-ORC-1 bound chromatin independently of ORC-2-5, and CDC-6 bound chromatin independently of ORC, whereas CDT-1 and MCM-2-7 DNA binding was interdependent. MCM-3 chromatin loading was irreversible, but CDC-6 and ORC turned over rapidly, consistent with ORC/CDC-6 loading multiple MCM-2-7 complexes. MCM-2-7 chromatin loading further reduced ORC and CDC-6 DNA binding. This dynamic behavior creates a feedback loop allowing ORC/CDC-6 to repeatedly load MCM-2-7 and distribute licensed origins along chromosomal DNA. During S phase, ORC and CDC-6 were excluded from nuclei, and DNA was overreplicated in export-defective cells. Thus, nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of licensing factors ensures that DNA replication occurs only once.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an evolutionary conserved DNA repair system that is essential for the removal of UV-induced DNA damage. In this study we investigated how NER is compartmentalized in the interphase nucleus of human cells at the ultrastructural level by using electron microscopy in combination with immunogold labeling. We analyzed the role of two nuclear compartments: condensed chromatin domains and the perichromatin region. The latter contains transcriptionally active and partly decondensed chromatin at the surface of condensed chromatin domains. We studied the distribution of the damage-recognition protein XPC and of XPA, which is a central component of the chromatin-associated NER complex. Both XPC and XPA rapidly accumulate in the perichromatin region after UV irradiation, whereas only XPC is also moderately enriched in condensed chromatin domains. These observations suggest that DNA damage is detected by XPC throughout condensed chromatin domains, whereas DNA-repair complexes seem preferentially assembled in the perichromatin region. We propose that UV-damaged DNA inside condensed chromatin domains is relocated to the perichromatin region, similar to what has been shown for DNA replication. In support of this, we provide evidence that UV-damaged chromatin domains undergo expansion, which might facilitate the translocation process. Our results offer novel insight into the dynamic spatial organization of DNA repair in the human cell nucleus.},

abstract = {Arabinocytidine and aphidicolin are inhibitors of alpha-DNA polymerase
that have been shown to affect both normal DNA replication and repair
synthesis in mammalian cells. In contradiction to the prevalent hypothesis
that these inhibitors merely slow the polymerization rate at incision
sites near lesions, our results suggest that the repair synthesis
resistant to inhibitors is mediated by a separate pathway. Repair
synthesis in contact-inhibited human cells following UV irradiation
was inhibited 75-80\% by arabinocytidine or aphidicolin, and most
of the repair patches were not ligated into parental DNA, as judged
by an enzymatic assay. However, the patches were not demonstrably
shorter than those in untreated cells. Even following low-UV doses
at which no inhibition of repair synthesis by the inhibitors was
observed, a majority of the patches were not ligated. DNA polymerase
beta is implicated in this alternate pathway, both by the known specificity
of the inhibitors and by evidence from their sensitivity to S1 nuclease
that the patches arise from displacement synthesis. The unligated
patches are not degraded in vivo and eventually become ligated into
parental DNA, very slowly in the presence of inhibitors but much
more rapidly following their removal. Thus, under conditions of alpha-polymerase
inhibition, a limited number of normal length repair patches are
made, apparently by displacement synthesis, leaving displaced strands
that remain substantially undegraded.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, nucleotide excision repair of DNA is a complex process
that requires many polypeptides to perform dual incision and remove
a segment of about 30 nucleotides containing the damage, followed
by repair DNA synthesis to replace the excised segment. Nucleotide
excision repair DNA synthesis is dependent on proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA). To study gap-filling DNA synthesis during
DNA nucleotide excision repair, UV-damaged DNA was first incubated
with PCNA-depleted human cell extracts to create repair incisions.
Purified DNA polymerase delta or epsilon, with DNA ligase, was then
used to form the repair patch. DNA polymerase delta could perform
repair synthesis and was strictly dependent on the presence of both
PCNA and replication factor C, but gave rise to a very low proportion
of complete, ligated circles. The presence of replication protein
A (which is also required for nucleotide excision repair) did not
alter this result, while addition of DNase IV increased the fraction
of ligated products. DNA polymerase epsilon, on the other hand, could
fill the repair patch in the absence of PCNA and replication factor
C, and most of the products were ligated circles. Addition of replication
protein A changed the situation dramatically, and synthesis by polymerase
epsilon became dependent on both PCNA and replication factor C. A
combination of DNA polymerase epsilon, PCNA, replication factor C,
replication protein A, and DNA ligase I appears to be well-suited
to the task of creating nucleotide excision repair patches.},

abstract = {DNA-damaging agents are commonly used as anticancer therapeutics. Unfortunately, such drugs induced DNA damages as well as DNA repair are important in mediating drug resistance to cancer treatments. To evaluate changes in DNA repair proteins that occur in DNA damage agent treatment, we challenged human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells with cisplatin. hHR23/RAD23, an accessory protein involved in nucleotide-excision repair (NER) at an early lesion-recognition step, was upregulated by cisplatin in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Upregulation of hHR23 expression by low-dose cisplatin was accompanied by an increase in p53, p21, and XPC protein levels. Importantly, knockdown of hHR23B by RNA interference decreased DNA repair activity, cell survival, and induction of p53 and XPC following treatment with cisplatin. Conversely, overexpression of hHR23B enhanced repair activity towards cisplatin-damaged DNA. Inhibition of MEK/ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways attenuated cisplatin-induced hHR23 expression, indicating that these pathways are involved in the process. The increase in hHR23 protein expression mediated by MEK/ERK signaling was due to increased translational efficiency resulting from phosphorylation/activation of the translation-initiating factor eIF-4B. Taken together, these results suggest that cisplatin-induced increases in hHR23 levels are regulated by proliferative signaling pathways and important for DNA repair.},

Here we present the structures of the DDB1-DDB2 complex alone and bound to DNA containing either a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photodimer (6-4PP) lesion or an abasic site. The structure shows that the lesion is held exclusively by the WD40 domain of DDB2. A DDB2 hairpin inserts into the minor groove, extrudes the photodimer into a binding pocket, and kinks the duplex by approximately 40 degrees. The tightly localized probing of the photolesions, combined with proofreading in the photodimer pocket, enables DDB2 to detect lesions refractory to detection by other damage surveillance proteins.

In the present study, we have extensively tested the relationship between the intranuclear mobility of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 and binding to its consensus target sequence. The affinity of p65 for this binding site is altered by mutation of specific acetylation sites, so these mutants provide a model system to study the relationship between specific DNA binding affinity and intranuclear mobility. DNA binding affinity was measured in vitro using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based method, and intranuclear mobility was measured using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique on yellow fluorescent protein-tagged p65 constructs. A negative correlation was observed between DNA binding affinity and intranuclear mobility of p65 acetylation site mutants. However, moving the yellow fluorescent protein tag from the C terminus of p65 to the N terminus resulted in an increased mobility but did not significantly affect DNA binding affinity. Thus, all changes in DNA binding affinity produce alterations in mobility, but not vice versa. Finally, a positive correlation was observed between mobility and the randomness of the intranuclear distribution of p65. Our data are in line with a model in which the intranuclear mobility and distribution of a transcription factor are determined by its affinity for specific DNA sequences, which may be altered by protein-protein interactions.},

and for the splicing mutation of intron 3 reported previously which
is the most common mutation in Japanese patients and creates a new
cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease AlwNI. The second
mutation was a nucleotide transition altering the Arg-207 codon (CGA)
to a nonsense codon (TGA). A Palestinian patient (XP12RO) who had
severe symptoms of XP was homozygous for this mutation. The third
mutation was a nucleotide transversion altering the Tyr-116 codon
(TAT) to a nonsense codon (TAA). This transversion creates a new
cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease MseI. Of the Japanese
patients, 2 with severe clinical symptoms had this mutant allele.
One was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and for the splicing
mutation, and the other was heterozygous for this mutation and homozygous
for the splicing mutation. Although most XP-A patients such as XP12RO
have severe skin symptoms and neurological abnormalities of the de
Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome, patient XP39OS was an atypical XP-A patient
who had mild skin symptoms and minimal neurological abnormalities.
Our results suggest that the clinical heterogeneity in XP-A is due
to different mutations in the XPAC gene. Moreover, our data indicate
that almost all Japanese cases of XP-A are caused by one or more
of the 3 mutations, i.e., the splicing mutation of intron 3 and the
2 nonsense mutations of codons 116 and 228. Therefore, by restriction
fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified DNA sequences
using the 3 restriction enzymes described above, rapid and reliable
diagnosis of XP-A can be achieved in almost all Japanese subjects
including prenatal cases and carriers.},

abstract = {The xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA) is a core component of nucleotide excision repair (NER). To coordinate early stage NER, XPA interacts with various proteins, including replication protein A (RPA), ERCC1, DDB2, and TFIIH, in addition to UV-damaged or chemical carcinogen-damaged DNA. In this study, we investigated the effects of mutations in the RPA binding regions of XPA on XPA function in NER. XPA binds through an N-terminal region to the middle subunit (RPA32) of the RPA heterotrimer and through a central region that overlaps with its damaged DNA binding region to the RPA70 subunit. In cell-free NER assays, an N-terminal deletion mutant of XPA showed loss of binding to RPA32 and reduced DNA repair activity, but it could still bind to UV-damaged DNA and RPA. In contrast, amino acid substitutions in the central region reduced incisions at the damaged site in the cell-free NER assay, and four of these mutants (K141A, T142A, K167A, and K179A) showed reduced binding to RPA70 but normal binding to damaged DNA. Furthermore, mutants that had one of the four aforementioned substitutions and an N-terminal deletion exhibited lower DNA incision activity and binding to RPA than XPA with only one of these substitutions or the deletion. Taken together, these results indicate that XPA interaction with both RPA32 and RPA70 is indispensable for NER reactions.},

abstract = {One of the longest standing problems in DNA repair is how cells relax chromatin in order to make DNA lesions accessible for global nucleotide excision repair (NER). Since chromatin has to be relaxed for efficient lesion detection, the key question is whether chromatin relaxation precedes lesion detection or vice versa. Chromatin accessibility factors have been proposed but not yet identified. Here we show that p53 acts as a chromatin accessibility factor, mediating UV-induced global chromatin relaxation. Using localized subnuclear UV irradiation, we demonstrate that chromatin relaxation is extended over the whole nucleus and that this process requires p53. We show that the sequence for initiation of global NER is as follows: transcription-associated lesion detection; p53-mediated global chromatin relaxation; and global lesion detection. The tumour suppressor p53 is crucial for genomic stability, a role partially explained by its pro-apoptotic capacity. We demonstrate here that p53 is also a fundamental component of DNA repair, playing a direct role in rectifying DNA damage.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky DNA lesions and is thus crucial for the protection against environmental carcinogens and UV light exposure. Deficiencies in NER cause increased mutation rates and chromosomal aberrations. Current methods for studying NER are mostly based on either quantitation of lesion removal or detection of repair DNA synthesis. Both have their limitations: lesion removal is inaccurate at very short times post-lesion, where the fraction of removal is low. Repair synthesis is difficult to apply to normally cycling cells due to the need to discriminate repair from replicative DNA synthesis. To overcome these problems we developed a method for analysis of NER based on detection of transient single-stranded (ss) DNA stretches generated at the nucleotide excision step. Cells are metabolically labelled with BrdU, exposed to UV-irradiation and the ssDNA transients generated during excision repair are detected using an anti-BrdU antibody. The method allows single-cell microscopic analysis of the distribution of DNA repair sites as well as kinetic analysis of the DNA repair response. Studies using various DNA repair-deficient cell lines indicate that the detection method integrates a number of pre-synthesis nucleotide excision repair stages. Thus, assembled repair sites can be detected even when they may not lead to complete resolution of the DNA lesion. Using this approach, we show that repair helicase-deficient cells differ from endonuclease-deficient cells.},

abstract = {Complementation group A of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) represents one
of the most prevalent and serious forms of this cancer-prone disorder.
Because of a marked defect in DNA excision repair, cells from individuals
with XP-A are hypersensitive to the toxic and mutagenic effects of
ultraviolet light and many chemical agents. We report here the isolation
of the XP-A DNA repair protein by complementation of cell extracts
from a repair-defective human XP-A cell line. XP-A protein purified
from calf thymus migrates on denaturing gel electrophoresis as a
doublet of 40 and 42 kilodaltons. The XP-A protein binds preferentially
to ultraviolet light-irradiated DNA, with a preference for damaged
over nondamaged nucleotides of approximately 10(3). This strongly
suggests that the XP-A protein plays a direct role in the recognition
of and incision at lesions in DNA. We further show that this protein
corresponds to the product encoded by a recently isolated gene that
can restore excision repair to XP-A cells. Thus, excision repair
of plasmid DNA by cell extracts sufficiently resembles genomic repair
in cells to reveal accurately the repair defect in an inherited disease.
The general approach described here can be extended to the identification
and isolation of other human DNA repair proteins.},

abstract = {Several genes in human cells are activated by physical genotoxic agents in order to regenerate cell homeostasis. Among the pathways contributing to this response, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is unique in restoring the nucleotide sequence of the DNA molecule without generating mutations. The first step of NER is mediated by a protein complex composed of XPC, RAD23B, an ubiquitin receptor and CENTRIN 2, an EF-hand calcium binding protein. These three proteins are multifunctional and participate in other important biochemical pathways. We silenced the XPC, RAD23A or RAD23B genes in HeLa cells for a long period of time by using Epstein Barr Virus-derived plasmids carrying sequences coding for small interfering RNA. XPC silencing confirms an essential role for XPC in DNA repair and cell survival after ultraviolet light irradiation. RAD23A and RAD23B participate in DNA repair and cell survival with diverging functions. Our data also indicate that CENTRIN 2 is recruited onto nuclear damaged areas quickly after irradiation and that XPC plays an important role during its internalization into the nucleus of human cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of XPC expression correlates with a decreased amount of CENTRIN 2 transcript and protein, indicating that XPC is required for the fine tuning of CENTRIN 2 gene expression. Moreover, XPC-silenced cells present a reduced concentration of CENTRIN 2 that affects both its centrosomal and nuclear localization suggesting that XPC deficiency may indirectly slow down cell division.},

A Systems Biology approach that combines quantitative experimental data with dynamic mathematical modeling promises to yield deeper insights into these processes. Nevertheless, with growing complexity and increasing amount of quantitative experimental data, building realistic and reliable mathematical models can become a challenging task: the quality of experimental data has to be assessed objectively, unknown model parameters need to be estimated from the experimental data, and numerical calculations need to be precise and efficient. Here, we discuss, compare and characterize the performance of computational methods throughout the process of quantitative dynamic modeling using two previously established examples, for which quantitative, dose- and time-resolved experimental data are available. In particular, we present an approach that allows to determine the quality of experimental data in an efficient, objective and automated manner. Using this approach data generated by different measurement techniques and even in single replicates can be reliably used for mathematical modeling. For the estimation of unknown model parameters, the performance of different optimization algorithms was compared systematically. Our results show that deterministic derivative-based optimization employing the sensitivity equations in combination with a multi-start strategy based on latin hypercube sampling outperforms the other methods by orders of magnitude in accuracy and speed. Finally, we investigated transformations that yield a more efficient parameterization of the model and therefore lead to a further enhancement in optimization performance. We provide a freely available open source software package that implements the algorithms and examples compared here.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mathematical description of biological reaction networks by differential equations leads to large models whose parameters are calibrated in order to optimally explain experimental data. Often only parts of the model can be observed directly. Given a model that sufficiently describes the measured data, it is important to infer how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. This knowledge is essential for further investigation of model predictions. For this reason a major topic in modeling is identifiability analysis.

RESULTS: We suggest an approach that exploits the profile likelihood. It enables to detect structural non-identifiabilities, which manifest in functionally related model parameters. Furthermore, practical non-identifiabilities are detected, that might arise due to limited amount and quality of experimental data. Last but not least confidence intervals can be derived. The results are easy to interpret and can be used for experimental planning and for model reduction.

The HMGN-mediated repression of chromatin remodeling is reversible and dynamic.

abstract = {We describe a broad mechanistic framework for the transcriptional induction of mammalian primary response genes by Toll-like receptors and other stimuli. One major class of primary response genes is characterized by CpG-island promoters, which facilitate promiscuous induction from constitutively active chromatin without a requirement for SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complexes. The low nucleosome occupancy at promoters in this class can be attributed to the assembly of CpG islands into unstable nucleosomes, which may lead to SWI/SNF independence. Another major class consists of non-CpG-island promoters that assemble into stable nucleosomes, resulting in SWI/SNF dependence and a requirement for transcription factors that promote selective nucleosome remodeling. Some stimuli, including serum and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, exhibit a strong bias toward activation of SWI/SNF-independent CpG-island genes. In contrast, interferon-beta is strongly biased toward SWI/SNF-dependent non-CpG-island genes. By activating a diverse set of transcription factors, Toll-like receptors induce both classes and others for an optimal response to microbial pathogens.},

Anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody recognizes the halogenated base analog incorporated into chromosomal DNA only when substituted DNA is in the single strand form. After treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents or gamma irradiation, ssDNA molecules form nuclear foci in a dose-dependent manner within 60 min. The mammalian recombination protein Rad51 and the replication protein A then accumulate at sites of ssDNA and form foci, suggesting that these are sites of recombinational DNA repair.},

abstract = {Although histone deacetylases (HDACs) are normally considered as co-repressors, HDAC1 has been identified as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Qiu, Y., Zhao, Y., Becker, M., John, S., Parekh, B. S., Huang, S., Hendarwanto, A., Martinez, E. D., Chen, Y., Lu, H., Adkins, N. L., Stavreva, D. A., Wiench, M., Georgel, P. T., Schiltz, R. L., and Hager, G. L. (2006) Mol. Cell 22, 669-679). Furthermore, HDAC1 is acetylated, and its acetylation level is linked to the transcription state of a GR-induced promoter (mouse mammary tumor virus). GR is also known to interact dynamically with regulatory elements in living cells (McNally, J. G., M\"{u}ller, W. G., Walker, D., Wolford, R., and Hager, G. L. (2000) Science 287, 1262-1265). However, HDAC1 dynamics have never been studied. We demonstrate here that HDAC1 also exchanges rapidly with promoter chromatin, and its exchange rate is significantly modulated during the development of promoter activity. Prior to induction, HDAC1 mobility was retarded compared with the exchange rate for GR. HDAC1 mobility then increased substantially, coordinately with the peak of promoter activity. At later time points, promoter activity was severely repressed, and HDAC1 mobility returned to the rate of exchange observed for the uninduced promoter. Thus, alterations of the exchange rates of HDAC1 at the promoter are correlated with the activity state of the promoter. These findings provide direct evidence for the functional role of highly mobile transcription factor complexes in transcription regulation.},

abstract = {Replication factor C (RF-C) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) assemble a complex, called sliding clamp, onto DNA. The clamp
in turn loads DNA polymerases (pol) delta and epsilon to form the
corresponding holoenzymes, which play an essential role in replication
of eukaryotic chromosomal DNA and in several DNA repair pathways.
To determine the fate of RF-C after loading of PCNA onto DNA, we
tagged the RF-C subunit p37 with a protein kinase A recognition motif,
so that the recombinant five-subunit RF-C complex could be 32P-labeled
and quantitatively detected in femtomolar amounts. Nonspecific binding
of RF-C to DNA was minimized by replacing the p140 subunit with an
N-terminally truncated p140 subunit lacking the previously identified
nonspecific DNA binding domain. Neither of these modifications impaired
the clamp loading activity of the recombinant RF-C. Using gel filtration
techniques, we demonstrated that RF-C dissociated from the DNA after
clamp loading or pol delta holoenzyme assembly, while PCNA or PCNA.pol
delta complex remained bound to DNA. PCNA catalytically loaded onto
the template-primer was sufficient by itself to tether pol delta
and stimulate DNA replication. The readdition of RF-C to the isolated
PCNA.DNA complex did not further stimulate pol delta DNA synthesis.
We conclude that pol delta holoenzyme consists of PCNA and pol delta
core and that RF-C serves only to load PCNA clamp.},

The high UV-induced skin cancer susceptibility of mice compared to man has been attributed to low expression of the UV-DDB subunit DDB2 in mouse skin cells. However, DDB2 knockout mice exhibit enhanced UVB skin carcinogenesis indicating that DDB2 protects mice against UV-induced skin cancer. To resolve these apparent contradictory findings, we systematically investigated the NER capacity of mouse fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Compared to fibroblasts, keratinocytes exhibited an increased level of UV-DDB activity, contained significantly higher levels of other NER proteins (i.e. XPC and XPB) and displayed efficient repair of CPD. At low UVB dosages, the difference in skin cancer susceptibility between DDB2 KO and wild type mice was even much more pronounced than previously reported with high dose UVB exposures. Hence, our observations show that mouse keratinocytes express sufficient levels of UV-DDB for efficient repair of photolesions and efficient protection against UV-induced skin cancer at physiological relevant UV exposure.},

from patients exhibit defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER).
XP proteins A-G are crucial in the processes of DNA damage recognition
and incision, and patients with XP can carry mutations in any of
the genes that specify these proteins. In mammalian cells, NER is
a dynamic process in which a variety of proteins interact with one
another, via modular domains, to carry out their functions. XP proteins
are key players in several steps of the NER process, including DNA
strand discrimination (XPA, in complex with replication protein A),
repair complex formation (XPC, in complex with hHR23B; XPF, in complex
with ERCC1) and repair factor recruitment (transcription factor IIH,
in complex with XPG). Through these protein-protein interactions,
various types of bulky DNA adducts can be recognized and repaired.
Communication between the NER system and other cellular pathways
is also achieved by selected binding of the various structural domains.
Here, we summarize recent studies on the domain structures of human
NER components and the regulatory networks that utilize these proteins.
Data provided by these studies have helped to illuminate the complex
molecular interactions among NER factors in the context of DNA repair.},

Then, is a gene transcribed because of its position, or is position determined by transcription? Are genes stochastically or deterministically engaged in transcription cycles? Recent results confirm that RNA polymerases and their transcription factors play central roles in genome organization, and that stochastic events can give rise to apparently deterministic expression. As is so often the case in biology, structure both determines function and is influenced by it.},

abstract = {Single-stranded DNA gaps that might arise by futile repair processes can lead to mutagenic events and challenge genome integrity. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an evolutionarily conserved repair mechanism, essential for removal of helix-distorting DNA lesions. In the currently prevailing model, NER operates through coordinated assembly of repair factors into pre- and post-incision complexes; however, its regulation in vivo is poorly understood. Notably, the transition from dual incision to repair synthesis should be rigidly synchronized as it might lead to accumulation of unprocessed repair intermediates. We monitored NER regulatory events in vivo using sequential UV irradiations. Under conditions that allow incision yet prevent completion of repair synthesis or ligation, preincision factors can reassociate with new damage sites. In contrast, replication protein A remains at the incomplete NER sites and regulates a feedback loop from completion of DNA repair synthesis to subsequent damage recognition, independently of ATR signaling. Our data reveal an important function for replication protein A in averting further generation of DNA strand breaks that could lead to mutagenic and recombinogenic events.},

abstract = {The XPB DNA helicase, a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIIH, is also involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). We examined recruitment of NER proteins in XP-B cells from patients with mild or severe xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) having different XPB mutations using local UV-irradiation through filters with 5 microm pores combined with fluorescent antibody labeling. XPC was rapidly recruited to UV damage sites containing DNA photoproducts (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, CPD) in all the XP-B and normal cells, thus reflecting its role in damage recognition prior to the function of XPB. Cells from the mild XP-B patients, with a missense mutation, showed delayed recruitment of all NER proteins except XPC to UV damage sites, demonstrating that this mutation impaired localization of these proteins. Surprisingly, in cells from severely affected patients, with a C-terminal XPB mutation, XPG and XPA proteins were normally recruited to UV damage sites demonstrating that this mutation permits recruitment of XPG and XPA. In marked contrast, in all the XP-B cells recruitment of XPF was absent immediately after UV and was delayed by 0.5 and 3 h in cells from the mild and severely affected XP patients, respectively. Redistribution of NER proteins was nearly complete in normal cells by 3 h but by 24 h redistribution was only partially present in cells from mild patients and virtually absent in cells from the severely affected patients. Ineffectual repair of UV-induced photoproducts resulting from delayed recruitment and impaired redistribution of NER proteins may contribute to the markedly increased frequency of skin cancer in XP patients.},

abstract = {DNA double strand breaks (DSB) may be caused by ionizing radiation. In contrast, UV exposure forms dipyrimidine photoproducts and is not considered an inducer of DSB. We found that uniform or localized UV treatment induced phosphorylation of the DNA damage related (DDR) proteins H2AX, ATM and NBS1 and co-localization of $\gamma$-H2AX with the DDR proteins p-ATM, p-NBS1, Rad51 and FANCD2 that persisted for about 6h in normal human fibroblasts. This post-UV phosphorylation was observed in the absence of nucleotide excision repair (NER), since NER deficient XP-B cells (lacking functional XPB DNA repair helicase) and global genome repair-deficient rodent cells also showed phosphorylation and localization of these DDR proteins. Resolution of the DDR proteins was dependent on NER, since they persisted for 24h in the XP-B cells. In the normal and XP-B cells p53 and p21 was detected at 6h and 24h but Mdm2 was not induced in the XP-B cells. Post-UV induction of Wip1 phosphatase was detected in the normal cells but not in the XP-B cells. DNA DSB were detected with a neutral comet assay at 6h and 24h post-UV in the normal and XP-B cells. These results indicate that UV damage can activate the DDR pathway in the absence of NER. However, a later step in DNA damage processing involving induction of Wip1 and resolution of DDR proteins was not observed in the absence of NER.},

Global genome repair of (6-4)pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts was significantly slower in hNT neurons than in the precursor cells, and repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) was not detected in the hNT neurons. This deficiency in global genome repair did not appear to be due to denser chromatin structure in hNT neurons. By contrast, CPDs were removed efficiently from both strands of transcribed genes in hNT neurons, with the nontranscribed strand being repaired unexpectedly well. Correlated with these changes in repair during neuronal differentiation were modifications in the expression of several repair genes, in particular an up-regulation of the two structure-specific nucleases XPG and XPF/ERCC1. These results have implications for neuronal dysfunction and aging.},

This review begins with a brief overview of the numerous types of DNA lesions handled by NER, and proceeds to describe in detail the molecular mechanisms of NER. It then addresses heterogeneities in NER activity in physiological situations (e. g. in differentiated cells) and explores the underlying regulatory mechanism. It then reviews several inherited diseases associated with NER deficiencies: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, UV-sensitive syndrome. It concludes by discussing several currently unresolved issues, relating either to the cause of the above diseases or to the mechanistic details of the various NER subpathways and of their regulation.

abstract = {Although the basic principle of nucleotide excision repair (NER), which can eliminate various DNA lesions, have been dissected at the genetic, biochemical and cellular levels, the important in vivo regulation of the critical damage recognition step is poorly understood. Here we analyze the in vivo dynamics of the essential NER damage recognition factor XPC fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed that the UV-induced transient immobilization of XPC, reflecting its actual engagement in NER, is regulated in a biphasic manner depending on the number of (6-4) photoproducts and titrated by the number of functional UV-DDB molecules. A similar biphasic UV-induced immobilization of TFIIH was observed using XPB-GFP. Surprisingly, subsequent integration of XPA into the NER complex appears to follow only the low UV dose immobilization of XPC. Our results indicate that when only a small number of (6-4) photoproducts are generated, the UV-DDB-dependent damage recognition pathway predominates over direct recognition by XPC, and they also suggest the presence of rate-limiting regulatory steps in NER prior to the assembly of XPA.},

abstract = {After exposure to DNA-damaging agents that block the progress of the replication fork, monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mediates the switch from replicative to translesion synthesis DNA polymerases. We show that in human cells, PCNA is monoubiquitinated in response to methyl methanesulfonate and mitomycin C, as well as UV light, albeit with different kinetics, but not in response to bleomycin or camptothecin. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are responsible for most of the PCNA ubiquitination events after UV-irradiation. Failure to ubiquitinate PCNA results in substantial sensitivity to UV and methyl methanesulfonate, but not to camptothecin or bleomycin. PCNA ubiquitination depends on Replication Protein A (RPA), but is independent of ATR-mediated checkpoint activation. After UV-irradiation, there is a temporal correlation between the disappearance of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 and the presence of PCNA ubiquitination, but this correlation was not found after chemical mutagen treatment. By using cells expressing photolyases, we are able to remove the UV lesions, and we show that PCNA ubiquitination persists for many hours after the damage has been removed. We present a model of translesion synthesis behind the replication fork to explain the persistence of ubiquitinated PCNA.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the only mechanism in humans to repair UV-induced DNA lesions such as pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). In response to UV damage, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase phosphorylates and activates several downstream effector proteins, such as p53 and XPA, to arrest cell cycle progression, stimulate DNA repair, or initiate apoptosis. However, following the completion of DNA repair, there must be active mechanisms that restore the cell to a prestressed homeostatic state. An important part of this recovery must include a process to reduce p53 and NER activity as well as to remove repair protein complexes from the DNA damage sites. Since activation of the damage response occurs in part through phosphorylation, phosphatases are obvious candidates as homeostatic regulators of the DNA damage and repair responses. Therefore, we investigated whether the serine/threonine wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1/PPM1D) might regulate NER. WIP1 overexpression inhibits the kinetics of NER and CPD repair, whereas WIP1 depletion enhances NER kinetics and CPD repair. This NER suppression is dependent on WIP1 phosphatase activity, as phosphatase-dead WIP1 mutants failed to inhibit NER. Moreover, WIP1 suppresses the kinetics of UV-induced damage repair largely through effects on NER, as XPD-deficient cells are not further suppressed in repairing UV damage by overexpressed WIP1. Wip1 null mice quickly repair their CPD and undergo less UV-induced apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts. In vitro phosphatase assays identify XPA and XPC as two potential WIP1 targets in the NER pathway. Thus WIP1 may suppress NER kinetics by dephosphorylating and inactivating XPA and XPC and other NER proteins and regulators after UV-induced DNA damage is repaired.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes the major UV-photolesions from cellular DNA. In humans, compromised NER activity is the cause of several photosensitive diseases, one of which is the skin-cancer predisposition disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Two assays commonly used in measurement of NER activity are 'unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS)', and 'recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS)', the latter being a specific measure of the transcription-coupled repair sub-pathway of NER. Both assays are key techniques for research in NER as well as in diagnoses of NER-related disorders. Until very recently, reliable methods for these assays involved measurements of incorporation of radio-labeled nucleosides. We have established non-radioactive procedures for determining UDS and RRS levels by incorporation of recently developed alkyne-conjugated nucleoside analogues, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and 5-ethynyuridine (EU). EdU and EU are respectively used as alternatives for (3)H-thymidine in UDS and for (3)H-uridine in RRS. Based on these alkyne-nucleosides and an integrated image analyser, we have developed a semi-automated assay system for NER-activity. We demonstrate the utility of this system for NER-activity assessments of lymphoblastoid samples as well as primary fibroblasts. Potential use of the system for large-scale siRNA-screening for novel NER defects as well as for routine XP diagnosis are also considered.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that eukaryotic DNA is arranged
in highly supercoiled domains or loops, and that the repeating loops
are constrained by attachment to a nuclear skeletal structure termed
the nuclear matrix. Active genes are transcribed at the nuclear matrix
and during replication the loops are reeled through fixed matrix-associated
replication complexes. We have investigated whether the repair of
DNA damage also occurs in the nuclear matrix compartment. Biochemical
analysis of confluent normal human fibroblasts, ultraviolet (u.v.)-irradiated
with 30 J m-2 and post-u.v. incubated in the presence of hydroxyurea,
did not show any evidence for the occurrence of repair synthesis
at the nuclear matrix either 30 min or 13 h after irradiation. Autoradiographic
visualization of repair events in single DNA halo-matrix structures
confirmed the biochemical observations. At a biologically more relevant
dose of 5 J m-2 repair synthesis seems to initiate at the nuclear
matrix, although only part of the total repair could be localized
there. In u.v.-irradiated (30 J m-2) normal human fibroblasts post-u.v.
incubated in the presence of hydroxyurea and arabinosylcytosine for
2 h, multiple single-stranded regions are generated in a DNA loop
as a result of the inhibition of the excision repair process. Different
biochemical approaches revealed that most of the single-stranded
regions are clustered, indicating that the repair process itself
is non-random or that domains in the chromatin are repaired at different
rates. Preferential repair of certain domains in the chromatin was
shown to occur in xeroderma pigmentosum cells of complementation
group C (XP-C). In XP-C cells these domains are localized near the
attachment sites of DNA loops at the nuclear matrix. In contrast,
xeroderma pigmentosum cells of complementation group D as well as
Syrian hamster embryonic cells with limited excision-repair capacities,
revealed a random distribution of repair events in DNA loops. The
preferential repair of matrix-associated DNA in XP-C cells may be
related partly to repair of transcriptionally active DNA and this
may account for the ability of XP-C cells, in contrast to XP-D cells,
to recover u.v.-inhibited synthesis of DNA and RNA.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair in humans is a complex reaction involving
14 polypeptides in six repair factors for dual incisions on either
sides of a DNA lesion. To identify the reaction intermediates that
form by the human excision repair nuclease, we adopted three approaches:
purification of functional DNA.protein complexes, permanganate footprinting,
and the employment as substrate of presumptive DNA reaction intermediates
containing unwound sequences 5' to, 3' to, or encompassing the DNA
lesion. The first detectable reaction intermediate was formed by
substrate binding of XPA, RPA, XPC.HHR23B plus TFIIH (preincision
complex 1, PIC1). In this complex the DNA was unwound on either side
of the lesion by no more than 10 bases. Independent of the XPG nuclease
function, the XPG protein stabilized this complex, forming a long
lived preincision complex 2 (PIC2). The XPF.ERCC1 complex bound to
PIC2, forming PIC3, which led to dual incisions and the release of
the excised oligomer. With partially unwound DNAs, thymine cyclobutane
dimer was excised at a fast rate independent of XPC.HHR23B, indicating
that a major function of this protein is to stabilize the unwound
DNA or to aid lesion unwinding in preincision complexes.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair consists of removal of the damaged nucleotide(s)
from DNA by dual incision of the damaged strand on both sides of
the lesion, followed by filling of the resulting gap and ligation.
In humans, 14-16 polypeptides are required for the dual incision
step. We have purified the required proteins to homogeneity and reconstituted
the dual incision activity (excision nuclease) in a defined enzyme/substrate
system. The system was highly efficient, removing >30\% of the thymine
dimers under optimal conditions. All of the six fractions that constitute
the excision nuclease were required for dual incision of the thymine
dimer substrate. However, when a cholesterol-substituted oligonucleotide
was used as substrate, excision occurred in the absence of the XPC-HHR23B
complex, reminiscent of transcription-coupled repair in the XP-C
mutant cell line. Replication protein A is absolutely required for
both incisions. The XPG subunit is essential to the formation of
the preincision complex, but the repair complex can assemble and
produce normal levels of 3'-incision in the absence of XPF-ERCC1.
Kinetic experiments revealed that the 3'-incision precedes the 5'-incision.
Consistent with the kinetic data, uncoupled 5'-incision was never
observed in the reconstituted system. Two forms of TFIIH were used
in the reconstitution reaction, one containing the CDK7-cyclin H
pair and one lacking it. Both forms were equally active in excision.
The excised oligomer dissociated from the gapped DNA in a nucleoprotein
complex. In total, these results provide a detailed account of the
reactions occurring during damage removal by human excision nuclease.},

However, the UV-damaged DNA binding protein (UV-DDB) has also been proposed as a damage recognition factor involved in repair of UV-photoproducts, especially CPD. Here, we show in human XP-E cells (UV-DDB deficient) that the incision complex formation at UV-induced lesions was severely diminished in locally damaged nuclear spots. Repair kinetics of CPD and 6-4PP in locally and globally UV-irradiated normal human and XP-E cells demonstrate that UV-DDB can mediate efficient targeting of XPC-hHR23B and other NER factors to 6-4PP. The data is consistent with a mechanism in which UV-DDB forms a stable complex when bound to a 6-4PP, allowing subsequent repair proteins--starting with XPC-hHR23B--to accumulate, and verify the lesion, resulting in efficient 6-4PP repair. These findings suggest that (i) UV-DDB accelerates repair of 6-4PP, and at later time points also CPD, (ii) the fraction of 6-4PP that can be bound by UV-DDB is limited due to its low cellular quantity and fast UV dependent degradation, and (iii) in the absence of UV-DDB a slow XPC-hHR23B dependent pathway is capable to repair 6-4PP, and to some extent also CPD.},

that two distinct complexes differentially carry out gap filling

Those parameters should have some permissible range so that the systems have robustness against perturbations, such as noise in gene expression. However, little is known about the permissible range in real cells because there has been no experimental technique to test it. In this study, we developed a genetic screening method, named "genetic tug-of-war" (gTOW) that evaluates upper limit copy numbers of genes in a model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we applied it for 30 cell-cycle related genes (CDC genes). The experiment provided unique quantitative data that could be used to argue the system-level properties of the cell cycle such as robustness and fragility. The data were used to evaluate the current computational model, and refinements to the model were suggested.},

abstract = {To address the biochemical mechanisms underlying the coordination between the various proteins required for nucleotide excision repair (NER), we employed the immobilized template system. Using either wild-type or mutated recombinant proteins, we identified the factors involved in the NER process and showed the sequential comings and goings of these factors to the immobilized damaged DNA. Firstly, we found that PCNA and RF-C arrival requires XPF 5' incision. Moreover, the positioning of RF-C is facilitated by RPA and induces XPF release. Concomitantly, XPG leads to PCNA recruitment and stabilization. Our data strongly suggest that this interaction with XPG protects PCNA and Pol delta from the effect of inhibitors such as p21. XPG and RPA are released as soon as Pol delta is recruited by the RF-C/PCNA complex. Finally, a ligation system composed of FEN1 and Ligase I can be recruited to fully restore the DNA. In addition, using XP or trichothiodystrophy patient-derived cell extracts, we were able to diagnose the biochemical defect that may prove to be important for therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {To address the biochemical mechanisms underlying the coordination
between the various proteins required for nucleotide excision repair
(NER), we employed the immobilized template system. Using either
wild-type or mutated recombinant proteins, we identified the factors
involved in the NER process and showed the sequential comings and
goings of these factors to the immobilized damaged DNA. Firstly,
we found that PCNA and RF-C arrival requires XPF 5' incision. Moreover,
the positioning of RF-C is facilitated by RPA and induces XPF release.
Concomitantly, XPG leads to PCNA recruitment and stabilization. Our
data strongly suggest that this interaction with XPG protects PCNA
and Pol delta from the effect of inhibitors such as p21. XPG and
RPA are released as soon as Pol delta is recruited by the RF-C/PCNA
complex. Finally, a ligation system composed of FEN1 and Ligase I
can be recruited to fully restore the DNA. In addition, using XP
or trichothiodystrophy patient-derived cell extracts, we were able
to diagnose the biochemical defect that may prove to be important
for therapeutic purposes.},

recognized by Rad4, whereas the two CPD-linked nucleotides become
disordered. These findings indicate that the lesions recognized by

abstract = {Human renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) is frequently associated with loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor (pVHL), which inhibits ubiquitylation and degradation of the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. pVHL also ubiquitylates the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rpb1, phosphorylated on serine 5 (Ser5) within the C-terminal domain (CTD). A hydroxylated proline 1465 within an LXXLAP motif located N-terminal to the CTD allows the interaction of Rpb1 with pVHL. Here we report that in RCC cells, pVHL regulates expression of Rpb1 and is necessary for low-grade oxidative-stress-induced recruitment of Rpb1 to the DNA-engaged fraction and for its P1465 hydroxylation, phosphorylation, and nondegradative ubiquitylation. Egln-9-type prolyl hydroxylases, PHD1 and PHD2, coimmunoprecipitated with Rpb1 in the chromatin fraction of VHL(+) RCC cells in response to oxidative stress, and PHD1 was necessary for P1465 hydroxylation while PHD2 had an inhibitory effect. P1465 hydroxylation was required for oxidative-stress-induced Ser5 phosphorylation of Rpb1. Importantly, overexpression of wild-type Rpb1 stimulated formation of kidney tumors by VHL(+) cells, and this effect was abolished by P1465A mutation of Rpb1. These data indicate that through this novel pathway involving P1465 hydroxylation and Ser5 phosphorylation of Rbp1, pVHL may regulate tumor growth.},

abstract = {The accumulation of DNA damage is a slow but hazardous phenomenon that may lead to cell death, accelerated aging features and cancer. One of the most versatile and important defense mechanisms against the accumulation of DNA damage is nucleotide excision repair (NER), in which the Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein plays a prominent role. NER can be divided into global genome repair (GG-NER) and transcription coupled repair (TC-NER). XPC is a key factor in GG-NER where it functions in DNA damage recognition and after which the repair machinery is recruited to eliminate the DNA damage. Defective XPC functioning has been shown to result in a cancer prone phenotype, in human as well as in mice. Mutation accumulation in XPC deficient mice is accelerated and increased, resulting in an increased tumor incidence. More recently XPC has also been linked to functions outside of NER since XPC deficient mice show a divergent tumor spectrum compared to other NER deficient mouse models. Multiple in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that XPC appears to be involved in the initiation of several DNA damage-induced cellular responses. XPC seems to function in the removal of oxidative DNA damage, redox homeostasis and cell cycle control. We hypothesize that this combination of increased oxidative DNA damage sensitivity, disturbed redox homeostasis together with inefficient cell cycle control mechanisms are causes of the observed increased cancer susceptibility in oxygen exposed tissues. Such a phenotype is absent in other NER-deficient mice, including Xpa.},

abstract = {The subcellular distribution and posttranslational modification of human chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) have been investigated after UV irradiation of HeLa cells. In an asynchronous cell population only a subfraction of the two large CAF-1 subunits, p150 and p60, were found to exist in a chromatin-associated fraction. This fraction is most abundant during S phase in nonirradiated cells and is much reduced in G2 cells. After UV irradiation, the chromatin-associated form of CAF-1 dramatically increased in all cells irrespective of their position in the cell cycle. Such chromatin recruitment resembles that seen for PCNA, a DNA replication and repair factor. The chromatin-associated fraction of p60 was predominantly hypophosphorylated in nonirradiated G2 cells. UV irradiation resulted in the rapid recruitment to chromatin of phosphorylated forms of the p60 subunit. Furthermore, the amount of the p60 and p150 subunits of CAF-1 associated with chromatin was a function of the dose of UV irradiation. Consistent with these in vivo observations, we found that the amount of CAF-1 required to stimulate nucleosome assembly during the repair of UV photoproducts in vitro depended upon both the number of lesions and the phosphorylation state of CAF-1. The recruitment of CAF-1 to chromatin in response to UV irradiation of human cells described here supports a physiological role for CAF-1 in linking chromatin assembly to DNA repair.},

To test whether changes of chromatin condensation levels per se affect access and binding of proteins, we used a hypertonic cell treatment. This shift to hyperosmolar medium increased nuclear calcium concentrations and induced a reversible chromatin condensation comparable to the levels in mitosis. However, this condensation was independent of mitotic histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation. Photobleaching and photoactivation experiments with chromatin proteins-histone H2B-GFP and GFP-HP1alpha-before and after induced chromatin condensation demonstrated that hypercondensation reduced their dissociation rate and stabilized their chromatin binding. Finally, measuring the distribution of nucleoplasmic proteins in the size range from 30 to 230 kDa, we found that even relatively small proteins like GFP were excluded from highly condensed chromatin in living cells. These results suggest that structural changes in condensed chromatin by themselves affect chromatin access and binding of chromatin proteins independent of regulatory histone modifications.-Martin, R.

In the immune system, remarkably large variability in the expression of cytokine genes has been observed in homogeneous populations of lymphocytes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we study the interleukin-4 gene (il4) in T-helper lymphocytes, combining mathematical modeling with the experimental quantification of expression variability and critical parameters. We show that a stochastic rate-limiting step upstream of transcription initiation, but acting at the level of an individual allele, controls il4 expression. Only a fraction of cells reaches an active, transcription-competent state in the transient time window determined by antigen stimulation. We support this finding by experimental evidence of a previously unknown short-term memory that was predicted by the model to arise from the long lifetime of the active state. Our analysis shows how a stochastic mechanism acting at the chromatin level can be integrated with transcriptional regulation to quantitatively control cell-to-cell variability.},

abstract = {In the last decade, live cell fluorescence microscopy experiments have revolutionized cellular and molecular biology, enabling the localization of proteins within cellular compartments to be analysed and to determine kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions in living nuclei to be measured. Recently, in vivo DNA labelling by DNA-stains such as DRAQ5, has provided the opportunity to measure kinetic reactions of GFP-fused proteins in targeted areas of the nucleus with different chromatin compaction levels. To verify the suitability of combining DRAQ5-staining with protein dynamic measurements, we have tested the cellular consequences of DRAQ5 DNA intercalation. We show that DRAQ5 intercalation rapidly modifies both the localization and the mobility properties of several DNA-binding proteins such as histones, DNA repair, replication and transcription factors, by stimulating a release of these proteins from their substrate. Most importantly, the effect of DRAQ5 on the mobility of essential cellular enzymes results in a potent inhibition of the corresponding cellular functions. From these observations, we suggest that great caution must be used when interpreting live cell data obtained using DRAQ5.},

abstract = {Type I interferons (IFN) are important components of the innate antiviral response. A key signalling pathway activated by IFN$\alpha$ is the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Major components of the pathway have been identified. However, critical kinetic properties that facilitate accelerated initiation of intracellular antiviral signalling and thereby promote virus elimination remain to be determined. By combining mathematical modelling with experimental analysis, we show that control of dynamic behaviour is not distributed among several pathway components but can be primarily attributed to interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), constituting a positive feedback loop. Model simulations revealed that increasing the initial IRF9 concentration reduced the time to peak, increased the amplitude and enhanced termination of pathway activation. These model predictions were experimentally verified by IRF9 over-expression studies. Furthermore, acceleration of signal processing was linked to more rapid and enhanced expression of IFN$\alpha$ target genes. Thus, the amount of cellular IRF9 is a crucial determinant for amplification of early dynamics of IFN$\alpha$-mediated signal transduction.},

abstract = {It was not known how xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein,
the primary initiator of global nucleotide excision repair, achieves
its outstanding substrate versatility. Here, we analyzed the molecular
pathology of a unique Trp690Ser substitution, which is the only reported
missense mutation in xeroderma patients mapping to the evolutionary
conserved region of XPC protein. The function of this critical residue
and neighboring conserved aromatics was tested by site-directed mutagenesis
followed by screening for excision activity and DNA binding. This
comparison demonstrated that Trp690 and Phe733 drive the preferential
recruitment of XPC protein to repair substrates by mediating an exquisite
affinity for single-stranded sites. Such a dual deployment of aromatic
side chains is the distinctive feature of functional oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding
folds and, indeed, sequence homologies with replication protein A
and breast cancer susceptibility 2 protein indicate that XPC displays
a monomeric variant of this recurrent interaction motif. An aversion
to associate with damaged oligonucleotides implies that XPC protein
avoids direct contacts with base adducts. These results reveal for
the first time, to our knowledge, an entirely inverted mechanism
of substrate recognition that relies on the detection of single-stranded
configurations in the undamaged complementary sequence of the double

isolated via ER cross-species complementation (ERCC) of UV-sensitive
CHO cells. We have now isolated and characterized cDNAs for the human
ERCC5 gene that complement CHO UV135 cells. The ERCC5 mRNA size is
about 4.6 kb. Our available cDNA clones are partial length, and no
single clone was active for UV135 complementation. When cDNAs were
mixed pairwise with a cosmid clone containing an overlapping 5'-end
segment of the ERCC5 gene, DNA transfer produced UV-resistant colonies
with 60 to 95\% correction of UV resistance relative to either a genomic
ERCC5 DNA transformant or the CHO AA8 progenitor cells. cDNA-cosmid
transformants regained intermediate levels (20 to 45\%) of ER-dependent
reactivation of a UV-damaged pSVCATgpt reporter plasmid. Our evidence
strongly implicates an in situ recombination mechanism in cDNA-cosmid
complementation for ER. The complete deduced amino acid sequence
of ERCC5 was reconstructed from several cDNA clones encoding a predicted
protein of 1,186 amino acids. The ERCC5 protein has extensive sequence
similarities, in bipartite domains A and B, to products of RAD repair
genes of two yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD2 and Schizosaccharomyces
pombe rad13. Sequence, structural, and functional data taken together
indicate that ERCC5 and its relatives are probable functional homologs.
A second locus represented by S. cerevisiae YKL510 and S. pombe rad2
genes is structurally distinct from the ERCC5 locus but retains vestigial
A and B domain similarities. Our analyses suggest that ERCC5 is a
nuclear-localized protein with one or more highly conserved helix-loop-helix
segments within domains A and B.},

abstract = {The C-terminal domain (CTD) of mammalian RNA polymerase II consists of 52 repeats of the consensus hepta-peptide YSPTSPS, and links transcription to the processing of pre-mRNA. Although Pol II with a CTD shortened to five repeats (Pol II Delta5) is transcriptionally inactive on chromatin templates, it is not clear whether CTD is required for promoter recognition in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that in the context of chromatin, Pol II Delta5 can bind to the c-myc promoter with the same efficiency as wild type Pol II. However, Pol II Delta5 does not form a stable initiation complex, and does not transcribe promoter proximal sequences. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments with cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Delta5 or wildtype Pol II revealed a single, highly mobile Pol II Delta5 fraction whereas wildtype Pol II yielded less mobile fractions. These data suggest that CTD is not required for promoter recognition, but rather for subsequent formation of a stable initiation complex and isomerization to an elongation competent complex.},

abstract = {HDAC1 and -2 are highly conserved enzymes and often coexist in the same coregulator complexes. Understanding the regulation of histone deacetylase activities is extremely important because these enzymes play key roles in epigenetic regulation in normal and cancer cells. We previously showed that HDAC1 is required for glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription activation and that its activity is regulated through acetylation by p300 during the induction cycle. Here, we showed that HDAC2 is also required for glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene activation. HDAC2, however, is regulated through a different mechanism from that of HDAC1. HDAC2 is not acetylated by p300, although 5 of 6 acetylated lysine residues in HDAC1 are also present in HDAC2. More importantly, the activity of HDAC2 is inhibited by acetylated HDAC1. Additionally, we showed that acetylated HDAC1 can trans-regulate HDAC2 through heterodimerization. Thus, this study uncovered fundamental differences between HDAC1 and HDAC2. It also unveiled a new mechanism of collaborative regulation by HDAC1/2 containing coregulator complexes.},

abstract = {To understand how multiprotein complexes assemble and function on chromatin, we combined quantitative analysis of the mammalian nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) machinery in living cells with computational modeling. We found that individual NER components exchange within tens of seconds between the bound state in repair complexes and the diffusive state in the nucleoplasm, whereas their net accumulation at repair sites evolves over several hours. Based on these in vivo data, we developed a predictive kinetic model for the assembly and function of repair complexes. DNA repair is orchestrated by the interplay of reversible protein-binding events and progressive enzymatic modifications of the chromatin substrate. We demonstrate that faithful recognition of DNA lesions is time consuming, whereas subsequently, repair complexes form rapidly through random and reversible assembly of NER proteins. Our kinetic analysis of the NER system reveals a fundamental conflict between specificity and efficiency of chromatin-associated protein machineries and shows how a trade off is negotiated through reversibility of protein binding.},

Recognition of DNA lesions by xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein in chromatin is stimulated by the damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2), which is part of a CUL4A-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) complex. In this paper, we report a new function of DDB2 in modulating chromatin structure at DNA lesions. We show that DDB2 elicits unfolding of large-scale chromatin structure independently of the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex. Our data reveal a marked adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent reduction in the density of core histones in chromatin containing UV-induced DNA lesions, which strictly required functional DDB2 and involved the activity of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase 1. Finally, we show that lesion recognition by XPC, but not DDB2, was strongly reduced in ATP-depleted cells and was regulated by the steady-state levels of poly(ADP-ribose) chains.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis allows bacteria to colonize their environment more efficiently and to find optimal growth conditions, and is consequently under strong evolutionary selection. Theoretical and experimental analyses of bacterial chemotaxis suggested that the pathway has been evolutionarily optimized to produce robust output under conditions of such physiological perturbations as stochastic intercellular variations in protein levels while at the same time minimizing complexity and cost of protein expression. Pathway topology in Escherichia coli apparently evolved to produce an invariant output under concerted variations in protein levels, consistent with experimentally observed transcriptional coupling of chemotaxis genes. Here, we show that the pathway robustness is further enhanced through the pairwise translational coupling of adjacent genes. Computer simulations predicted that the robustness of the pathway against the uncorrelated variations in protein levels can be enhanced by a selective pairwise coupling of individual chemotaxis genes on one mRNA, with the order of genes in E. coli ranking among the best in terms of noise compensation. Translational coupling between chemotaxis genes was experimentally confirmed, and coupled expression of these genes was shown to improve chemotaxis. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed that E. coli gene order corresponds to consensus in sequenced bacterial genomes, confirming evolutionary selection for noise reduction. Since polycistronic gene organization is common in bacteria, translational coupling between adjacent genes may provide a general mechanism to enhance robustness of their signaling and metabolic networks. Moreover, coupling between expression of neighboring genes is also present in eukaryotes, and similar principles of noise reduction might thus apply to all cellular networks.},

The in vivo structure of damaged eukaryotic replication intermediates has been so far elusive. Combining electron microscopy (EM) and two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, we found that UV-irradiated S. cerevisiae cells uncouple leading and lagging strand replication at irreparable UV lesions, thus generating long ssDNA regions on one side of the fork. Furthermore, small ssDNA gaps accumulate along replicated duplexes, likely resulting from repriming events downstream of the lesions on both leading and lagging strands. Translesion synthesis and homologous recombination counteract gap accumulation, without affecting fork progression. The DNA damage checkpoint contributes to gap repair and maintains a replication-competent fork structure. We propose that the coordinated action of checkpoint, recombination, and translesion synthesis-mediated processes at the fork and behind the fork preserves the integrity of replicating chromosomes by allowing efficient replication restart and filling the resulting ssDNA gaps.},

Interphase cells consistently show three populations of chromatin with low, medium, or high FRET efficiency, reflecting spatially distinct regions with different levels of chromatin compaction. Treatment with inhibitors that either increase chromatin compaction (i.e., depletion of adenosine triphosphate) or decrease chromosome compaction (trichostatin A) results in a parallel increase or decrease in the FLIM-FRET signal. In mitosis, the assay showed variation in compaction level, as reflected by different FRET efficiency populations, throughout the length of all chromosomes, increasing to a maximum in late anaphase. These data are consistent with extensive higher order folding of chromatin fibers taking place during anaphase.},

abstract = {Positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a cellular protein kinase that is required for RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcriptional elongation of protein coding genes. P-TEFb is a set of different molecular complexes, each containing CDK9 as the catalytic subunit. There are two isoforms of the CDK9 protein - the major 42KDa CDK9 isoform and the minor 55KDa isoform that is translated from an in-frame mRNA that arises from an upstream transcriptional start site. We found that shRNA depletion of the 55K CDK9 protein in HeLa cells induces apoptosis and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The levels of apoptosis and DSBs induced by the depletion were reduced by expression of a 55K CDK9 protein variant resistant to the shRNA, indicating that these phenotypes are the consequence of depletion of the 55K protein and not off-target effects. We also found that the 55K CDK9 protein, but not the 42K CDK9 protein, specifically associates with Ku70, a protein involved in DSB repair. Our findings suggest that the 55K CDK9 protein may function in repair of DNA through an association with Ku70.},

abstract = {The retinoblastoma Rb/E2F tumor suppressor pathway plays a major role in the regulation of mammalian cell cycle progression. The pRb protein, along with closely related proteins p107 and p130, exerts its anti-proliferative effects by binding to the E2F family of transcription factors known to regulate essential genes throughout the cell cycle. We sought to investigate the role of the Rb/E2F1 pathway in the lesion recognition step of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Rb-/-, p107-/-, p130-/- MEFs repaired both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) at higher efficiency than did wildtype cells following UV-C irradiation. The expression of damaged DNA binding gene DDB2 involved in the DNA lesion recognition step was elevated in the Rb family-deficient MEFs. To determine if the enhanced DNA repair in the absence of the Rb gene family is due to the derepression of E2F1, we assayed the ability of E2F1-deficient cells to repair damaged DNA and demonstrated that E2F1-/- MEFs are impaired for the removal of both CPDs and 6-4PPs. Furthermore, wildtype cells induced a higher expression of DDB2 and xeroderma pigmentosum gene XPC transcript levels than did E2F1-/- cells following UV-C irradiation. Using an E2F SiteScan algorithm, we uncovered a putative E2F-responsive element in the XPC promoter upstream of the transcription start site. We showed with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays the binding of E2F1 to the XPC promoter in a UV-dependent manner, suggesting that E2F1 is a transcriptional regulator of XPC. Our study identifies a novel E2F1 gene target and further supports the growing body of evidence that the Rb/E2F1 tumor suppressor pathway is involved in the regulation of the DNA lesion recognition step of nucleotide excision repair.},

abstract = {Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is recognized as one of the promising targets for cancer treatment as many HDAC inhibitors have entered clinical trials for both solid and liquid tumors. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative effects of HDAC inhibitors remain elusive. Although they have been shown to regulate the transcription of a defined set of genes through chromatin remodeling, increasing evidence suggests that modifications of the epigenetic histone code may not be the primary mechanism for HDAC inhibitor-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in cancer cells. While histones still represent a primary target for the physiological function of HDACs, the antitumor effect of HDAC inhibitors might also be attributed to transcription-independent mechanisms by modulating the acetylation status of a series of nonhistone targets. Also noteworthy is the effect of HDAC inhibitors on Akt downregulation through the alteration of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex formation. To provide an overview of the use of HDAC inhibitors in cancer treatment, this review addresses the following subjects: (1) the physiological relevance of HDAC-mediated acetylation of histone and nonhistone substrates, (2) the chemical biology of HDACs and development of a novel class of HDAC inhibitors, and (3) the protein acetylation-independent effect of HDAC inhibitors on the activation status of signaling kinases.},

abstract = {Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Afflicted patients show extreme sun-sensitivity and skin cancer predisposition. XP is in most cases associated with deficient nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is the process responsible for removing photolesions from DNA. Measuring NER activity by nucleotide incorporation into repair patches, termed 'unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS)', is one of the most commonly used assays for XP-diagnosis and NER research. We have established a rapid and accurate procedure for measuring UDS by replacement of thymidine with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU). EdU incorporated into repair patches can be directly conjugated to fluorescent azide derivatives, thereby obviating the need for either radiolabeled thymidine or denaturation and antibody detection of incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). We demonstrate that the EdU incorporation assay is compatible with conventional techniques such as immunofluorescent staining and labeling of cells with micro-latex beads. Importantly, we can complete the entire UDS assay within half a day from preparation of the assay coverslips; this technique may prove useful as a method for XP diagnosis.},

Here we report that RPA and the human repair protein XPA specifically
interact both in vitro and in vivo. Mapping of the RPA-interactive
domains in XPA revealed that both of the largest subunits of RPA,
RPA-70 and RPA-34, interact with XPA at distinct sites. A domain
involved in mediating the interaction with RPA-70 was located between
XPA residues 153 and 176. Deletion of highly conserved motifs within
this region identified two mutants that were deficient in binding
RPA in vitro and highly defective in NER both in vitro and in vivo.
A second domain mediating the interaction with RPA-34 was identified
within the first 58 residues in XPA. Deletion of this region, however,
only moderately affects the complementing activity of XPA in vivo.
Finally, the XPA-RPA complex is shown to have a greater affinity
for damaged DNA than XPA alone. Taken together, these results indicate
that the interaction between XPA and RPA is required for NER but
that only the interaction with RPA-70 is essential.},

Accordingly, repair of MMC-induced damages involves multiple repair pathways such as nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination repair and translesion bypass repair pathways. Nonetheless, repair of the MMC-induced DNA damages in mammals have not been fully delineated. In this study, we investigated potential roles for Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) proteins in the repair of MMC-induced DNA damages using an assay that detects the ssDNA patches generated following treatment with MMC or 8'-methoxy-psoralen (8-MOP) + UVA (ultraviolet light A). Human wild-type cells formed distinctive ssDNA foci following treatment with MMC or 8-MOP + UVA, but not with those inducing alkylation damage, oxidative damage or strand-break damage, suggesting that the foci represent ssDNA patches formed during the crosslink repair. In contrast to wild-type cells, mutant defective in XPE orXPG did not form the ssDNA foci following MMC treatment, while XPF mutant cells showed a significantly delayed response in forming the foci. A positive role for XPG in the repair of MMC-induced DNA damages was further supported by observations that cells treated with MMC induced a tight association of XPG with chromatin, and a targeted inhibition of XPG abolished MMC-induced ssDNA foci formation, rendering cells hypersensitive to MMC. Together, our results suggest that XPG along with XPE and XPF play unique role(s) in the repair of MMC-induced DNA damages.},

This recruitment occurs in absence of exogenous genotoxic attack, is sensitive to transcription inhibitors, and depends on the XPC protein. The presence of these repair proteins at the promoter of activated genes is necessary in order to achieve optimal DNA demethylation and histone posttranslational modifications (H3K4/H3K9 methylation, H3K9/14 acetylation) and thus efficient RNA synthesis. Deficiencies in some NER factors impede the recruitment of others and affect nuclear receptor transactivation. Our data suggest that there is a functional difference between the presence of the NER factors at the promoters (which requires XPC) and the NER factors at the distal regions of the gene (which requires CSB). While the latter may be a repair function, the former is a function with respect to transcription unveiled in the current study.},

abstract = {The heterochromatin-enriched HP1 proteins play a critical role in regulation of transcription. These proteins contain two related domains known as the chromo- and the chromoshadow-domain. The chromo-domain binds histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor and that the opening of chromatin occurring during DNA replication facilitates their binding to nucleosomes. These observations prompted us to investigate whether HP1 proteins have additional histone binding activities, envisioning also affinity for regions potentially occluded by the nucleosome structure. We find that the chromoshadow-domain interacts with histone H3 in a region located partially inside the nucleosomal barrel at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome. Interestingly, this region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex. In vitro, efficient SWI/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. The antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 proteins is also observed in vivo on a series of interferon-regulated genes. Finally, we show that SWI/SNF activity favors loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling.},

abstract = {Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), which removes a variety of helix-distorting lesions from DNA, is initiated by two distinct DNA damage-sensing mechanisms. Transcription Coupled Repair (TCR) removes damage from the active strand of transcribed genes and depends on the SWI/SNF family protein CSB. Global Genome Repair (GGR) removes damage present elsewhere in the genome and depends on damage recognition by the XPC/RAD23/Centrin2 complex. Currently, it is not well understood to what extent both pathways contribute to genome maintenance and cell survival in a developing organism exposed to UV light. Here, we show that eukaryotic NER, initiated by two distinct subpathways, is well conserved in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In C. elegans, involvement of TCR and GGR in the UV-induced DNA damage response changes during development. In germ cells and early embryos, we find that GGR is the major pathway contributing to normal development and survival after UV irradiation, whereas in later developmental stages TCR is predominantly engaged. Furthermore, we identify four ISWI/Cohesin and four SWI/SNF family chromatin remodeling factors that are implicated in the UV damage response in a developmental stage dependent manner. These in vivo studies strongly suggest that involvement of different repair pathways and chromatin remodeling proteins in UV-induced DNA repair depends on developmental stage of cells.},

abstract = {The high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is a highly abundant protein with roles in several cellular processes, including chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation, as well as an extracellular role in inflammation. HMGB1's most thoroughly defined function is as a protein capable of binding specifically to distorted and damaged DNA, and its ability to induce further bending in the DNA once it is bound. This characteristic in part mediates its function in chromatin structure (binding to the linker region of nucleosomal DNA and increasing the instability of the nucleosome structure) as well as transcription (bending promoter DNA to enhance the interaction of transcription factors), but the functional consequences of HMGB1's binding to damaged DNA is still an area of active investigation. In this review we describe HMGB1's actions in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, and we discuss aspects of both the "repair shielding" and "repair enhancing" hypotheses that have been suggested. We also report information regarding HMGB1's roles in the mismatch repair (MMR), nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and V(D)J recombination pathways, as well as its newly-discovered involvement in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We further explore the potential of HMGB1 in DNA repair in the context of chromatin. The elucidation of HMGB1's role in DNA repair is critical for the complete understanding of HMGB1's intracellular functions, which is particularly relevant in the context of anti-HMGB1 therapies that are being developed to treat inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is a multifunctional protein with roles in chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation, V(D)J recombination, and inflammation. HMGB1 also binds to and bends damaged DNA, but the biological consequence of this interaction is not clearly understood. We have shown previously that HMGB1 binds cooperatively with nucleotide excision repair damage recognition proteins to triplex-directed psoralen DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). Thus, we hypothesized that HMGB1 modulates the repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells. We demonstrate here that mammalian cells lacking HMGB1 are hypersensitive to DNA damage induced by psoralen plus UVA irradiation (PUVA) or UVC radiation, showing less survival and increased mutagenesis. In addition, nucleotide excision repair efficiency is significantly decreased in the absence of HMGB1 as assessed by the repair and removal of UVC lesions from genomic DNA. We also explored the role of HMGB1 in chromatin remodeling upon DNA damage. Immunoblotting demonstrated that, in contrast to HMGB1 proficient cells, cells lacking HMGB1 showed no histone acetylation upon DNA damage. Additionally, purified HMGB1 protein enhanced chromatin formation in an in vitro chromatin assembly system. These results reveal a role for HMGB1 in the error-free repair of DNA lesions. Its absence leads to increased mutagenesis, decreased cell survival, and altered chromatin reorganization after DNA damage. Because strategies targeting HMGB1 are currently in development for treatment of sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis, our findings draw attention to potential adverse side effects of anti-HMGB1 therapy in patients with inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits nucleotide excision repair (NER) in human cells, a process that contributes to the skin cancer proneness in organ transplant patients. We investigated the mechanisms of CsA-induced NER reduction by assessing all xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) genes (XPA-XPG). Western blot analyses revealed that XPA and XPG protein expression was reduced in normal human GM00637 fibroblasts exposed to 0.1 and 0.5 $\mu$m CsA. Interestingly, the CsA treatment reduced XPG, but not XPA, mRNA expression. Calcineurin knockdown in GM00637 fibroblasts using RNAi led to similar results suggesting that calcineurin-dependent signalling is involved in XPA and XPG protein regulation. CsA-induced reduction in NER could be complemented by the overexpression of either XPA or XPG protein. Likewise, XPA-deficient fibroblasts with stable overexpression of XPA (XP2OS-pCAH19WS) did not show the inhibitory effect of CsA on NER. In contrast, XPC-deficient fibroblasts overexpressing XPC showed CsA-reduced NER. Our data indicate that the CsA-induced inhibition of NER is a result of downregulation of XPA and XPG protein in a calcineurin-dependent manner.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting a system's behavior based on a mathematical model is a primary task in Systems Biology. If the model parameters are estimated from experimental data, the parameter uncertainty has to be translated into confidence intervals for model predictions. For dynamic models of biochemical networks, the nonlinearity in combination with the large number of parameters hampers the calculation of prediction confidence intervals and renders classical approaches as hardly feasible. RESULTS: In this article reliable confidence intervals are calculated based on the prediction profile likelihood. Such prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states can be utilized for a data-based observability analysis. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters yielding to some insufficiently specified model predictions that can be interpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is introduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be interpreted. CONCLUSIONS: The presented methodology allows the propagation of uncertainty from experimental to model predictions. Although presented in the context of ordinary differential equations, the concept is general and also applicable to other types of models. Matlab code which can be used as a template to implement the method is provided at http://www.fdmold.uni-freiburg.de/∼ckreutz/PPL.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Quantitative experimental data is the critical bottleneck in the modeling of dynamic cellular processes in systems biology. Here, we present statistical approaches improving reproducibility of protein quantification by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting.

RESULTS: Based on a large data set with more than 3600 data points, we unravel that the main sources of biological variability and experimental noise are multiplicative and log-normally distributed. Therefore, we suggest a log-transformation of the data to obtain additive normally distributed noise. After this transformation, common statistical procedures can be applied to analyze the data. An error model is introduced to account for technical as well as biological variability. Elimination of these systematic errors decrease variability of measurements and allow for a more precise estimation of underlying dynamics of protein concentrations in cellular signaling. The proposed error model is relevant for simulation studies, parameter estimation and model selection, basic tools of systems biology.

abstract = {Multiple cell types involved in the regulation of angiogenesis express Wnt ligands. Although $\beta$-catenin dependent and independent Wnt signaling pathways have been shown to control angiogenesis, the contribution of individual cell types to activate these downstream pathways in endothelial cells (ECs) during blood vessel formation is still elusive. To investigate the role of ECs in contributing Wnt ligands for regulation of blood vessel formation, we conditionally deleted the Wnt secretion factor Evi in mouse ECs (Evi-ECKO). Evi-ECKO mice showed decreased microvessel density during physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the postnatal retina and in tumors, respectively. The reduced microvessel density resulted from increased vessel regression accompanied by decreased EC survival and proliferation. Concomitantly, survival-related genes were downregulated and cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-inducing genes were upregulated. EVI silencing in cultured HUVECs showed similar target gene regulation, supporting a mechanism of EC-derived Wnt ligands in controlling EC function. ECs preferentially expressed non-canonical Wnt ligands and canonical target gene expression was unaffected in Evi-ECKO mice. Furthermore, the reduced vascularization of Matrigel plugs in Evi-ECKO mice could be rescued by introduction of non-canonical Wnt5a. Treatment of mouse pups with the non-canonical Wnt inhibitor TNP470 resulted in increased vessel regression accompanied by decreased EC proliferation, thus mimicking the proliferation-dependent Evi-ECKO remodeling phenotype. Taken together, this study identified EC-derived non-canonical Wnt ligands as regulators of EC survival, proliferation and subsequent vascular pruning during developmental and pathological angiogenesis.},

Laser microirradiation ranging in wavelength from ultraviolet A (UVA) to near-infrared (NIR) can be used to induce damage in a defined region in the cell nucleus, representing an innovative technology to effectively analyze the in vivo DNA double-strand break (DSB) damage recognition process in mammalian cells. However, the damage-inducing characteristics of the different laser systems have not been fully investigated. Here we compare the nanosecond nitrogen 337 nm UVA laser with and without bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), the nanosecond and picosecond 532 nm green second-harmonic Nd:YAG, and the femtosecond NIR 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser with regard to the type(s) of damage and corresponding cellular responses. Crosslinking damage (without significant nucleotide excision repair factor recruitment) and single-strand breaks (with corresponding repair factor recruitment) were common among all three wavelengths. Interestingly, UVA without BrdU uniquely produced base damage and aberrant DSB responses. Furthermore, the total energy required for the threshold H2AX phosphorylation induction was found to vary between the individual laser systems. The results indicate the involvement of different damage mechanisms dictated by wavelength and pulse duration. The advantages and disadvantages of each system are discussed.},

abstract = {Cellular biochemical networks have to function in a noisy environment using imperfect components. In particular, networks involved in gene regulation or signal transduction allow only for small output tolerances, and the underlying network structures can be expected to have undergone evolution for inherent robustness against perturbations. Here we combine theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate an optimal design for the signalling network of bacterial chemotaxis, one of the most thoroughly studied signalling networks in biology. We experimentally determine the extent of intercellular variations in the expression levels of chemotaxis proteins and use computer simulations to quantify the robustness of several hypothetical chemotaxis pathway topologies to such gene expression noise. We demonstrate that among these topologies the experimentally established chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli has the smallest sufficiently robust network structure, allowing accurate chemotactic response for almost all individuals within a population. Our results suggest that this pathway has evolved to show an optimal chemotactic performance while minimizing the cost of resources associated with high levels of protein expression. Moreover, the underlying topological design principles compensating for intercellular variations seem to be highly conserved among bacterial chemosensory systems.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) acts on a variety of DNA lesions, including damage induced by many chemotherapeutic drugs. Cancer therapy with such drugs might be improved by reducing the NER capacity of tumors. It is not known, however to what extent any individual NER protein is rate-limiting for any step of the repair reaction. We studied sensitivity to UV radiation and repair of DNA damage with regard to XPA, one of the core factors in the NER incision complex. About 150,000-200,000 molecules of XPA protein are present in NER proficient human cell lines, and no XPA protein in the XP-A cell line XP12RO. Transfected XP12RO cell lines expressing 50,000 or more XPA molecules/cell showed UV resistance similar to normal cells. Suppression of XPA protein to approximately 10,000 molecules/cell in a Tet-regulatable system modestly but significantly increased sensitivity to UV irradiation. No removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was detected in the SV40 immortalized cell lines tested. Repair proficient WI38-VA fibroblasts and transfected XP-A cells expressing 150,000 molecules of XPA/cell removed (6-4) photoproducts from the genome with a half-life of 1h. Cells in which XPA protein was reduced to about 10,000 molecules/cell removed (6-4) photoproducts more slowly, with a half-life of 3h. A reduced rate of repair of (6-4) photoproducts thus results in increased cellular sensitivity towards UV irradiation. These data indicate that XPA levels must be reduced to <10\% of that present in a normal cell to render XPA a limiting factor for NER and consequent cellular sensitivity. To inhibit NER, it may be more effective to interfere with XPA protein function, rather than reducing XPA protein levels.},

abstract = {Under classical models for signal-dependent transcription in eukaryotes, DNA-binding activator proteins regulate the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to a set of target promoters. However, recent studies, as well as our results herein, show that Pol II is widely distributed (i.e., "preloaded") at the promoters of many genes prior to specific signaling events. How Pol II recruitment and Pol II preloading fit within a unified model of gene regulation is unclear. In addition, the mechanisms through which cellular signals activate preloaded Pol II across mammalian genomes remain largely unknown. We show here that the predominant genomic outcome of estrogen signaling is the postrecruitment regulation of Pol II activity at target gene promoters, likely through specific changes in Pol II phosphorylation rather than through recruitment of Pol II to the promoters. Furthermore, we show that negative elongation factor binds to estrogen target promoters in conjunction with preloaded Pol II and represses gene expression until the appropriate signal is received. Finally, our studies reveal that the estrogen-dependent activation of preloaded Pol II facilitates rapid gene regulatory responses which play important physiological roles in regulating estrogen signaling itself. Our results reveal a broad use of postrecruitment Pol II regulation by the estrogen signaling pathway, a mode of regulation that is likely to apply to a wide variety of signal-regulated pathways.},

We estimated the numbers of various components of such complexes in an HeLa cell by quantitative immunoblotting. The cells were lysed with saponin in a physiological buffer; approximately 140,000 unengaged polymerases (mainly of form IIA) were released. Only approximately 4,000 of these soluble molecules sedimented in glycerol gradients as holoenzyme-sized complexes. About 180,000 molecules of polymerases (approximately 110,000 molecules of form IIO) and 10,000 to 30,000 molecules of each of TFIIB, TFIIEalpha, TFIIEbeta, TFIIF-RAP74, TFIIF-RAP30, and TFIIH-MAT1 remained tightly associated with the nuclear substructure. Most proteins and run-on activity were retained when approximately 50\% of the chromatin was detached with a nuclease, but approximately 45,000 molecules of bound TATA binding protein (TBP) were detached. Similar results were obtained after cross-linking living cells with formaldehyde. The results provide little support for the existence of a large pool of soluble holoenzyme; they are consistent with TBP-promoter complexes in nuclease-sensitive chromatin being assembled into preinitiation complexes attached to the underlying structure.},

Here we have studied the induction of IFN by parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) at the single-cell level, using a cell line expressing GFP under the control of the IFN-$\beta$ promoter. We demonstrate that a recombinant PIV5 (termed PIV5-V$\Delta$C) that lacks a functional V protein (the viral IFN antagonist) does not activate the IFN-$\beta$ promoter in the majority of infected cells. We conclude that viral PAMPs capable of activating the IFN induction cascade are not produced or exposed during the normal replication cycle of PIV5, and suggest instead that defective viruses are primarily responsible for inducing IFN during PIV5 infection in this system.},

abstract = {A human DNA damage binding protein implicated in the DNA excision repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum E was purified to near homogeneity from HeLa cells. The protein is abundant (approximately 10(5) copies/cell) and has a native molecular weight of 154,000-163,000 as estimated by gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation. DNA damage binding activity copurified with polypeptides of 124 and 41 kDa. Based on the native molecular weight, cosedimentation of both polypeptides with DNA damage binding activity on glycerol gradients, and a molar ratio of approximately 1:1 for the two polypeptides, it appears that p124 and p41 are subunits of a heterodimeric protein. Binding to damaged DNA was resistant to K+ concentrations approaching 1 M, but showed anion-specific sensitivity to Cl- concentrations above 0.5 M, suggesting that the majority of the binding energy is contributed by nonionic interactions. In contrast to previous reports, the DNA damage binding protein was shown to recognize cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in addition to a nonphotoreactivable lesion(s), most likely the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct.},

abstract = {DNA-repair endonuclease activity in response to UV-induced DNA damage
was quantified in diploid human fibroblasts after synchronizing cell
cultures to selected stages of the cell cycle. Incubation of irradiated
cells with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases alpha and
delta, delayed the sealing of repair patches and allowed estimation
of rates of strand incision by the repair endonuclease. The apparent
Vmax for endonucleolytic incision and Km for substrate utilization
were determined by Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee analyses. For
cells passing through G1, S or G2, Vmax for reparative incision was,
respectively, 7.6, 8.4 and 8.4 breaks/10(10) Da per min, suggesting
that there was little variation in incision activity during these
cell-cycle phases. The Km values of 2.4-3.1 J/m2 for these cells
indicate that the nucleotidyl DNA excision-repair pathway operates
with maximal effectiveness after low fluences of UV that are in the
shoulder region of survival curves. Fibroblasts in mitosis demonstrated
a severe attenuation of reparative incision. Rates of incision were
11\% of those seen in G2 cells. Disruption of nuclear structure during
mitosis may reduce the effective concentration of endonuclease in
the vicinity of damaged chromatin. The extreme condensation of chromatin
during mitosis also may restrict the accessibility of reparative
endonuclease to sites of DNA damage. Confluence-arrested fibroblasts
in G0 expressed endonuclease activity with Vmax of 5.5 breaks/10(10)
Da per min and a Km of 5.5 J/m2. The greater condensation of chromatin
in quiescent cells may restrict the accessibility of endonuclease
to dimers and so explain the elevated Km. When fibroblasts were synchronized
by serum-deprivation, little variation in reparative endonuclease
activity was discerned as released cells transited from early G1
through late G1 and early S. Proliferating fibroblasts in G1 were
shown to express comparatively high numbers of reparative incision
events in the absence of aphidicolin which was normally used to inhibit
DNA polymerases and hold repair patches open. It was calculated that
in G0, S and G2 phase cells, single-strand breaks at sites of repair
remained open for 30, 19 and 14 sec, respectively. In G1 phase cells,
repair sites remained open for 126 sec. Addition of deoxyribonucleosides
to G1 cells reduced this time to 42 sec suggesting that the slower
rate of synthesis and ligation of repair patches in G1 was due to
a relative deficiency of deoxyribonucleotidyl precursors for DNA
polymerase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

fast cycle occurs on natural promoters, and the function of either

fraction of accessible promoters rather than the recruitment and
release of stably bound transcriptional activators. This observation,
combined with single-cell measurements of messenger RNA (mRNA) production,
argues that fast cycling initiates transcription and that slow cycling
regulates the quantity of mRNA produced. These findings counter the
prevailing view that slow cycling initiates transcription.},

We show that BRG1and BRM associate with different promoters during cellular proliferation and differentiation, and in response to specific signaling pathways by preferential interaction with certain classes of transcription factors. BRG1 binds to zinc finger proteins through a unique N-terminal domain that is not present in BRM. BRM interacts with two ankyrin repeat proteins that are critical components of Notch signal transduction.

abstract = {The xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing protein (XPAC) is
involved in an early step of nucleotide excision repair, the main
process that removes UV damage and many chemical lesions from DNA.
To explore the properties and function of XPAC, recombinant protein
encoded by the human XPAC cDNA was expressed with an N-terminal polyhistidine
tag in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The soluble
fusion protein could correct the repair defect in vitro of XP-A cell
extracts. XPAC protein bound to DNA with a preference for UV-irradiated
over nonirradiated DNA, as determined by a gel electrophoresis mobility
shift assay with a 258 base pair DNA fragment (the association constant
was approximately 3 x 10(6) M-1 for the fragment irradiated with
6 kJ/m2 UV light). Removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from
UV-irradiated DNA by enzymatic photoreactivation did not significantly
reduce binding of XPAC to the irradiated fragment, indicating that
binding was mostly due to (6-4) photoproducts, with a preference
for a (6-4) photoproduct over an undamaged base pair up to 300-fold.
Undamaged single-stranded DNA competed about 4-fold more effectively
than undamaged double-stranded DNA for binding of XPAC to a UV-irradiated
fragment. In addition, XPAC bound to DNA treated with the chemotherapeutic
agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II). The results suggest that
XPAC functions as a key component in recognition of DNA damage during
repair.},

abstract = {The creation of accessible DNA in the context of chromatin is a key step in many DNA functions. To reveal how ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities impact DNA repair, we constructed mammalian genetic models for the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex and investigated the impact of loss of INO80 function on the repair of UV-induced photo lesions. We showed that deletion of two core components of the INO80 complex, INO80 and ARP5, significantly hampered cellular removal of UV-induced photo lesions but had no significant impact on the transcription of nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors. Loss of INO80 abolished the assembly of NER factors, suggesting that prior chromatin relaxation is important for the NER incision process. Ino80 and Arp5 are enriched to UV-damaged DNA in an NER-incision-independent fashion, suggesting that recruitment of the remodeling activity likely takes place during the initial stage of damage recognition. These results demonstrate a critical role of INO80 in creating DNA accessibility for the NER pathway and provide direct evidence that repair of UV lesions and perhaps most bulky adduct lesions requires chromatin reconfiguration.},

The first is a simian virus 40 (SV40) shuttle system which allows a quasi-stable episomal vector/host relationship in which the shuttle vector may be recovered in extrachromosomal DNA preparations many months after transfection and selection but in which a high proportion of the plasmids rescued in bacteria are heavily mutated and rearranged. Secondly, we describe Epstein-Barr virus-based shuttle-expression vectors which exist as stable, multicopy episomes in human cells. Using a reporter gene and a metal-inducible promoter we have obtained low basal and very high induced expression from episomal vectors in a variety of human cells including xeroderma pigmentosum and ataxia telangiectasia cell lines. This should facilitate many molecular genetic experiments in human cells and may have particular application to molecular cloning, expression and analysis of DNA repair genes.},

Mutations in XPG found in XP-G/CS patient cells that prevent the association with TFIIH also resulted in the dissociation of CAK and XPD from the core TFIIH. As a consequence, the phosphorylation and transactivation of nuclear receptors were disturbed in XP-G/CS as well as xpg(-/-) MEF cells and could be restored by expression of wild-type XPG.

abstract = {The PAR-3-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-PAR-6 complex has been implicated in the development of apicobasal polarity and the formation of tight junctions (TJs) in vertebrate epithelial cells. It is recruited by junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) to primordial junctions where aPKC is activated by Rho family small guanosine triphosphatases. In this paper, we show that aPKC can interact directly with JAM-A in a PAR-3-independent manner. Upon recruitment to primordial junctions, aPKC phosphorylates JAM-A at S285 to promote the maturation of immature cell-cell contacts. In fully polarized cells, S285-phosphorylated JAM-A is localized exclusively at the TJs, and S285 phosphorylation of JAM-A is required for the development of a functional epithelial barrier. Protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates JAM-A at S285, suggesting that it antagonizes the activity of aPKC. Expression of nonphosphorylatable JAM-A/S285A interferes with single lumen specification during cyst development in three-dimensional culture. Our data suggest that aPKC phosphorylates JAM-A at S285 to regulate cell-cell contact maturation, TJ formation, and single lumen specification.},

abstract = {In human cells, efficient global genomic repair of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation requires the p53 tumor suppressor, but the mechanism has been unclear. The p48 gene is required for expression of an ultraviolet radiation-damaged DNA binding activity and is disrupted by mutations in the subset of xeroderma pigmentosum group E cells that lack this activity. Here, we show that p48 mRNA levels strongly depend on basal p53 expression and increase further after DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, like p53(-/-) cells, xeroderma pigmentosum group E cells are deficient in global genomic repair. These results identify p48 as the link between p53 and the nucleotide excision repair apparatus.},

abstract = {XPF is a structure-specific endonuclease that preferentially cleaves 3' DNA flaps during a variety of repair processes. The crystal structure of a crenarchaeal XPF protein bound to a DNA duplex yielded insights into how XPF might recognise branched DNA structures, and recent kinetic data have demonstrated that the sliding clamp PCNA acts as an essential cofactor, possibly by allowing XPF to distort the DNA structure into a proper conformation for efficient cleavage to occur. Here, we investigate the solution structure of the 3'-flap substrate bound to XPF in the presence and absence of PCNA using intramolecular F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We demonstrate that recognition of the flap substrate by XPF involves major conformational changes of the DNA, including a 90 degrees kink of the DNA duplex and organization of the single-stranded flap. In the presence of PCNA, there is a further substantial reorganization of the flap substrate bound to XPF, providing a structural basis for the observation that PCNA has an essential catalytic role in this system. The wider implications of these observations for the plethora of PCNA-dependent enzymes are discussed.},

abstract = {The induction of interferon beta (IFNB1) is a key event in the antiviral immune response. We studied the role of transcriptional noise in the regulation of the IFNB1 locus in primary cultures of human dendritic cells (DCs), which are important 'first responders' to viral infection. In single cell assays, IFNB1 mRNA expression in virus-infected DCs showed much greater cell-to-cell variation than that of a housekeeping gene, another induced transcript and viral RNA. We determined the contribution of intrinsic noise by measuring the allelic origin of transcripts in each cell and found that intrinsic noise is a very significant part of total noise. We developed a stochastic model to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We propose that the surprisingly high levels of IFNB1 transcript noise originate from the complexity of IFNB1 enhanceosome formation, which leads to a range up to many minutes in the differences within each cell in the time of activation of each allele.},

abstract = {In the first few hours following Newcastle disease viral infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, the induction of IFNB1 is extremely low and the secreted type I interferon response is below the limits of ELISA assay. However, many interferon-induced genes are activated at this time, for example DDX58 (RIGI), which in response to viral RNA induces IFNB1. We investigated whether the early induction of IFNBI in only a small percentage of infected cells leads to low level IFN secretion that then induces IFN-responsive genes in all cells. We developed an agent-based mathematical model to explore the IFNBI and DDX58 temporal dynamics. Simulations showed that a small number of early responder cells provide a mechanism for efficient and controlled activation of the DDX58-IFNBI positive feedback loop. The model predicted distributions of single cell responses that were confirmed by single cell mRNA measurements. The results suggest that large cell-to-cell variation plays an important role in the early innate immune response, and that the variability is essential for the efficient activation of the IFNB1 based feedback loop.},

Analysis of data from the direct measurement of the expression of this gene in its natural chromatin environment in primary human cells shows that the distribution of mRNA across cells follows a power law with an exponent close to -1, and thus encompasses a range of variation much more extensive than a Gaussian. We also investigate the single cell levels of IFNB1 mRNA induced by infection with Texas influenza A mutant viruses, which vary in their capacity to inhibit the signaling pathways responsible for activation of this gene. Here as well we observe power-law behavior for the distribution of IFNB1 mRNA, albeit over a truncated range of values, with exponents similar to the one for cells infected by Newcastle disease virus. We propose a model of stochastic enhanceosome and preinitiation complex formation that incorporates transcriptional pulsing. Analytical and numerical results show good agreement with the observed power laws, and thus support the existence of transcriptional pulsing of an unmodified, intact gene regulated by a natural stimulus.},

A tetramer, d(GT(6-4)TC), was prepared, and its degradation in 50 mm KOH at 60 degrees C was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography. A single peak with a UV absorption spectrum similar to that of the starting material was detected after the reaction, and this compound was regarded as an intermediate before the strand break. The formation of this intermediate was compared with intermediates from the degradation of other alkali-labile lesions such as the abasic site, thymine glycol, and 5,6-dihydrothymine. The results strongly suggested that the first step of the alkali degradation of the (6-4) photoproduct was the hydrolysis between the N3 and C4 positions of the 5'-pyrimidine component. Analyses by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry supported the chemical structure of this product. Assays of the complex formation with XPC.HR23B and the translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase eta revealed that the biochemical properties are indistinguishable between the intact and hydrolyzed photoproducts.},

abstract = {The XPC-HR23B complex is a prime candidate for the initial damage
recognition step during global genome nucleotide excision repair.
A specific interaction between the XPC-HR23B complex and various
types of damaged DNA substrates has been demonstrated in recent work
by electrophoretic mobility shift assays or immunoprecipitation.
Although these studies allowed the estimation of relative binding
affinities for the different types of lesions, the presence of large
amounts of competitor DNA or the need for glutaraldehyde fixation
prevented the quantification of equilibrium constants. We have performed
a quantitative study on the binding of XPC to damaged DNA using fluorescence
anisotropy measurements. The XPC-HR23B complex binds with high affinity
(K(D) approximately 1-3 nM) to fluorescent 36 bp DNA fragments containing
a single cisplatin 1,3-intrastrand adduct or a six-nucleotide mispaired
region. From stoichiometric titration experiments, it is concluded
that approximately 70\% of the XPC-HR23B preparation is active in
DNA binding. Binding experiments employing fluorescent probes with
a single defined photoproduct reveal a 30-fold preference of XPC
for 6,4-photoproducts as compared to a cyclobutane dimer. Competition

abstract = {Replication protein A (RPA) is a multisubunit, single-stranded DNA-binding
protein that is absolutely required for replication of SV40 DNA.
The three cDNAs encoding the subunits of human replication protein
A (70, 32, and 14 kDa) have been expressed individually and in combination
in Escherichia coli. When subunits were expressed individually, appropriately
sized polypeptides were synthesized, but were found to be either
insoluble or aggregated with other proteins. We examined the interactions
between individual RPA subunits by expressing pairs of subunits and
determining if they formed stable complexes. Only the 32- and 14-kDa
subunits formed a soluble complex when coexpressed. This complex
was purified and characterized. The 32-14 kDa subcomplex did not
have any effect on DNA replication and was not phosphorylated efficiently
in vitro. We believe that the 32.14-kDa subcomplex may be a precursor
in the assembly of the complete RPA complex. Coexpression of all
three subunits of RPA resulted in a significant portion of each polypeptide
forming a soluble complex. We have purified recombinant RPA complex
from E. coli and demonstrated that it has properties similar to those
of human RPA. Recombinant human RPA has the same subunit composition
and the same activities as the authentic complex from human cells.
Recombinant human RPA binds single-stranded DNA and is capable of
supporting SV40 DNA replication in vitro. In addition, recombinant
RPA became phosphorylated when incubated under replication conditions.},

@article{Harper2011,
abstract = {In individual mammalian cells the expression of some genes such as prolactin is highly variable over time and has been suggested to occur in stochastic pulses. To investigate the origins of this behavior and to understand its functional relevance, we quantitatively analyzed this variability using new mathematical tools that allowed us to reconstruct dynamic transcription rates of different reporter genes controlled by identical promoters in the same living cell. Quantitative microscopic analysis of two reporter genes, firefly luciferase and destabilized EGFP, was used to analyze the dynamics of prolactin promoter-directed gene expression in living individual clonal and primary pituitary cells over periods of up to 25 h. We quantified the time-dependence and cyclicity of the transcription pulses and estimated the length and variation of active and inactive transcription phases. We showed an average cycle period of approximately 11 h and demonstrated that while the measured time distribution of active phases agreed with commonly accepted models of transcription, the inactive phases were differently distributed and showed strong memory, with a refractory period of transcriptional inactivation close to 3 h. Cycles in transcription occurred at two distinct prolactin-promoter controlled reporter genes in the same individual clonal or primary cells. However, the timing of the cycles was independent and out-of-phase. For the first time, we have analyzed transcription dynamics from two equivalent loci in real-time in single cells. In unstimulated conditions, cells showed independent transcription dynamics at each locus. A key result from these analyses was the evidence for a minimum refractory period in the inactive-phase of transcription. The response to acute signals and the result of manipulation of histone acetylation was consistent with the hypothesis that this refractory period corresponded to a phase of chromatin remodeling which significantly increased the cyclicity. Stochastically timed bursts of transcription in an apparently random subset of cells in a tissue may thus produce an overall coordinated but heterogeneous phenotype capable of acute responses to stimuli.},

XPB is a subunit of a multifunctional RNA polymerase II general initiation
factor TFIIH and codes for 3'-->5' DNA helicase essential for both
nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Since XPB defective
human disease is extremely rare, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant
cell lines belonging to the 3rd rodent complementation group (the
hamster ERCC3 gene is the homologue of the human XPB gene) are a
unique resource for analyzing structure-function relationships in
the ERCC3/XPB protein. We have amplified, cloned and sequenced the
ERCC3 genes from wild type and 27-1, UV24 and MMC-2 CHO mutant cell
lines and identified the sites of the respective mutations. 27-1
mutant has an A1075G transition (K359E) located at the very beginning
of the Ia helicase domain which causes deficiency in open complex
formation and in 3', 5' and dual incisions during NER. UV24 cell
line has two mutations. First, it is a T1144C transition (S382P)
located behind the Ia helicase domain in a region responsible for
ERCC3 binding to XPG, p62 and p44. Second mutation is identical with
a mutation in MMC-2 mutant. It is a C2215T transition (Q739STOP)
causing the truncation of the C-terminus of the protein, responsible
for the 5' incision, by 44 amino acids. All mutant cell lines are
unable to recover RNA synthesis after 10Jm(-2) UV, suggesting a defect
in transcription-coupled repair. Their limited global NER capacity

of chromatin structure. In each case, the epigenetic information

developed method for the localized UV irradiation of cells, we analysed
responses that occur locally to damage sites and global events triggered
by local damage recognition. We thus demonstrate that, within a single
cell, the recruitment of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) to UV-induced
DNA damage is a strictly local phenomenon, restricted to damage sites.
Concomitantly, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) locates
to the same sites. This localized recruitment suggests that CAF-1
participates directly in chromatin structural rearrangements that
occur in the vicinity of the damage. Use of nucleotide excision repair
(NER)-deficient cells shows that the NER pathway--specifically dual
incision--is required for recruitment of CAF-1 and PCNA. This in
vivo demonstration of the local role of CAF-1, depending directly

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants CFP and YFP is widely used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Nowadays, several monomeric red-shifted fluorescent proteins are available that potentially improve the efficiency of FRET.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To allow side-by-side comparison of several fluorescent protein combinations for detection of FRET, yellow or orange fluorescent proteins were directly fused to red fluorescent proteins. FRET from yellow fluorescent proteins to red fluorescent proteins was detected by both FLIM and donor dequenching upon acceptor photobleaching, showing that mCherry and mStrawberry were more efficient acceptors than mRFP1. Circular permutated yellow fluorescent protein variants revealed that in the tandem constructs the orientation of the transition dipole moment influences the FRET efficiency. In addition, it was demonstrated that the orange fluorescent proteins mKO and mOrange are both suitable as donor for FRET studies. The most favorable orange-red FRET pair was mKO-mCherry, which was used to detect homodimerization of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 in single living cells, with a threefold higher lifetime contrast and a twofold higher FRET efficiency than for CFP-YFP.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The observed high FRET efficiency of red-shifted couples is in accordance with increased F\"{o}rster radii of up to 64 A, being significantly higher than the F\"{o}rster radius of the commonly used CFP-YFP pair. Thus, red-shifted FRET pairs are preferable for detecting protein-protein interactions by donor-based FRET methods in single living cells.},

abstract = {Studies based on cell-free systems and on in vitro-cultured living cells support the concept that many cellular processes, such as transcription initiation, are highly dynamic: individual proteins stochastically bind to their substrates and disassemble after reaction completion. This dynamic nature allows quick adaptation of transcription to changing conditions. However, it is unknown to what extent this dynamic transcription organization holds for postmitotic cells embedded in mammalian tissue. To allow analysis of transcription initiation dynamics directly into living mammalian tissues, we created a knock-in mouse model expressing fluorescently tagged TFIIH. Surprisingly and in contrast to what has been observed in cultured and proliferating cells, postmitotic murine cells embedded in their tissue exhibit a strong and long-lasting transcription-dependent immobilization of TFIIH. This immobilization is both differentiation driven and development dependent. Furthermore, although very statically bound, TFIIH can be remobilized to respond to new transcriptional needs. This divergent spatiotemporal transcriptional organization in different cells of the soma revisits the generally accepted highly dynamic concept of the kinetic framework of transcription and shows how basic processes, such as transcription, can be organized in a fundamentally different fashion in intact organisms as previously deduced from in vitro studies.},

II transcription and nucleotide excision repair (NER). This multi-subunit
complex consists of ten polypeptides, including the recently identified
small 8-kDa trichothiodystrophy group A (TTDA)/ hTFB5 protein. Patients
belonging to the rare neurodevelopmental repair syndrome TTD-A carry
inactivating mutations in the TTDA/hTFB5 gene. One of these mutations
completely inactivates the protein, whereas other TFIIH genes only
tolerate point mutations that do not compromise the essential role
in transcription. Nevertheless, the severe NER-deficiency in TTD-A
suggests that the TTDA protein is critical for repair. Using a fluorescently
tagged and biologically active version of TTDA, we have investigated
the involvement of TTDA in repair and transcription in living cells.
Under non-challenging conditions, TTDA is present in two distinct
kinetic pools: one bound to TFIIH, and a free fraction that shuttles
between the cytoplasm and nucleus. After induction of NER-specific
DNA lesions, the equilibrium between these two pools dramatically
shifts towards a more stable association of TTDA to TFIIH. Modulating
transcriptional activity in cells did not induce a similar shift
in this equilibrium. Surprisingly, DNA conformations that only provoke
an abortive-type of NER reaction do not result into a more stable
incorporation of TTDA into TFIIH. These findings identify TTDA as
the first TFIIH subunit with a primarily NER-dedicated role in vivo
and indicate that its interaction with TFIIH reflects productive
NER.},

abstract = {Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a pleiotropic disease, with a characteristic hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation that is caused by biallelic mutations in A-T mutated (ATM), a gene encoding a protein kinase critical for the induction of cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly to DNA double strand breaks. A long known characteristic of A-T cells is their ability to synthesize DNA even in the presence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, a phenomenon termed radioresistant DNA synthesis. We previously reported that ATM kinase inhibition, but not ATM protein disruption, blocks sister chromatid exchange following DNA damage. We now show that ATM kinase inhibition, but not ATM protein disruption, also inhibits DNA synthesis. Investigating a potential physical interaction of ATM with the DNA replication machinery, we found that ATM co-precipitates with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from cellular extracts. Using bacterially purified ATM truncation mutants and in vitro translated PCNA, we showed that the interaction is direct and mediated by the C terminus of ATM. Indeed, a 20-amino acid region close to the kinase domain is sufficient for strong binding to PCNA. This binding is specific to ATM, because the homologous regions of other PIKK members, including the closely related kinase A-T and Rad3-related (ATR), did not bind PCNA. ATM was found to bind two regions in PCNA. To examine the functional significance of the interaction between ATM and PCNA, we tested the ability of ATM to stimulate DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase $\delta$, which is implicated in both DNA replication and DNA repair processes. ATM was observed to stimulate DNA polymerase activity in a PCNA-dependent manner.},

abstract = {The encounter of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) with DNA lesions has severe consequences for the cell as this event provides a strong signal for P53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. To counteract prolonged blockage of transcription, the cell removes the RNAPIIo-blocking DNA lesions by transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Exposure of mice to UVB light or chemicals has elucidated that TC-NER is a critical survival pathway protecting against acute toxic and long-term effects (cancer) of genotoxic exposure. Deficiency in TC-NER is associated with mutations in the CSA and CSB genes giving rise to the rare human disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS). Recent data suggest that CSA and CSB play differential roles in mammalian TC-NER: CSB as a repair coupling factor to attract NER proteins, chromatin remodellers and the CSA- E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to the stalled RNAPIIo. CSA is dispensable for attraction of NER proteins, yet in cooperation with CSB is required to recruit XAB2, the nucleosomal binding protein HMGN1 and TFIIS. The emerging picture of TC-NER is complex: repair of transcription-blocking lesions occurs without displacement of the DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo, and requires at least two essential assembly factors (CSA and CSB), the core NER factors (except for XPC-RAD23B), and TC-NER specific factors. These and yet unidentified proteins will accomplish not only efficient repair of transcription-blocking lesions, but are also likely to contribute to DNA damage signalling events.},

It is believed that the heterodimeric proteins XPC/hHR23B and UV-DDB (UV-damaged DNA binding factor, composed of the p48 and p127 subunits) perform this function in genomic DNA, but their requirement and lesion specificity in vivo remains unknown. Using repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)-A cells that stably express photoproduct-specific photolyases, we determined the binding characteristics of p48 and XPC to either CPDs or 6-4PPs in vivo. p48 localized to UV-irradiated sites that contained either CPDs or 6-4PPs. However, XPC localized only to UV-irradiated sites that contained 6-4PPs, suggesting that XPC does not efficiently recognize CPDs in vivo. XPC did localize to CPDs when p48 was overexpressed in the same cell, signifying that p48 activates the recruitment of XPC to CPDs and may be the initial recognition factor in the NER pathway.},

abstract = {How tightly packed chromatin is thoroughly inspected for DNA damage is one of the fundamental unanswered questions in biology. In particular, the effective excision of carcinogenic lesions caused by the ultraviolet (UV) radiation of sunlight depends on UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB), but the mechanism by which this DDB1-DDB2 heterodimer stimulates DNA repair remained enigmatic. We hypothesized that a distinctive function of this unique sensor is to coordinate damage recognition in the nucleosome repeat landscape of chromatin. Therefore, the nucleosomes of human cells have been dissected by micrococcal nuclease, thus revealing, to our knowledge for the first time, that UV-DDB associates preferentially with lesions in hypersensitive, hence, highly accessible internucleosomal sites joining the core particles. Surprisingly, the accompanying CUL4A ubiquitin ligase activity is necessary to retain the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) partner at such internucleosomal repair hotspots that undergo very fast excision kinetics. This CUL4A complex thereby counteracts an unexpected affinity of XPC for core particles that are less permissive than hypersensitive sites to downstream repair subunits. That UV-DDB also adopts a ubiquitin-independent function is evidenced by domain mapping and in situ protein dynamics studies, revealing direct but transient interactions that promote a thermodynamically unfavorable $\beta$-hairpin insertion of XPC into substrate DNA. We conclude that the evolutionary advent of UV-DDB correlates with the need for a spatiotemporal organizer of XPC positioning in higher eukaryotic chromatin.},

We have started to develop experimental tools to investigate the close cooperation of homologous recombination proteins in living cells, where proteins operate in the context of chromatin and in the presence of other nuclear processes. This chapter describes in detail methods to establish cell lines stably expressing green fluorescent protein -tagged recombination proteins and photobleaching techniques to investigate the behavior of the proteins with the use of live cell video microscopy. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss after photobleaching (FLIP), and their combination in the same cell are useful techniques to gain insights into the dynamic behavior of the recombination proteins. Parameters such as diffusion rates and mobile versus immobile fractions before and after DNA damage induction can be obtained. In addition, residence times of recombination proteins at sites of DNA damage can be determined. Through the application of FRAP and FLIP it is possible to establish whether proteins are present in the same multiprotein complex, whether this is affected by DNA damage induction, and whether proteins dynamically associate with and dissociate from sites of DNA damage.},

antigen (PCNA) is central to both DNA replication and repair. The
ring-shaped homotrimeric PCNA encircles and slides along double-stranded
DNA, acting as a "sliding clamp" that localizes proteins to DNA.
We determined the behavior of green fluorescent protein-tagged human
PCNA (GFP-hPCNA) in living cells to analyze its different engagements
in DNA replication and repair. Photobleaching and tracking of replication
foci revealed a dynamic equilibrium between two kinetic pools of
PCNA, i.e., bound to replication foci and as a free mobile fraction.
To simultaneously monitor PCNA action in DNA replication and repair,
we locally inflicted UV-induced DNA damage. A surprisingly longer
residence time of PCNA at damaged areas than at replication foci
was observed. Using DNA repair mutants, we showed that the initial
recruitment of PCNA to damaged sites was dependent on nucleotide
excision repair. Local accumulation of PCNA at damaged regions was
observed during all cell cycle stages but temporarily disappeared
during early S phase. The reappearance of PCNA accumulation in discrete
foci at later stages of S phase likely reflects engagements of PCNA
in distinct genome maintenance processes dealing with stalled replication
forks, such as translesion synthesis (TLS). Using a ubiquitination
mutant of GFP-hPCNA that is unable to participate in TLS, we noticed
a significantly shorter residence time in damaged areas. Our results
show that changes in the position of PCNA result from de novo assembly
of freely mobile replication factors in the nucleoplasmic pool and
indicate different binding affinities for PCNA in DNA replication

abstract = {A large portion of the eukaryotic genome is packaged into transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Several factors that play important roles during the establishment and maintenance of this condensed form have been identified. Methylation of lysine 9 within histone H3 and the subsequent binding of the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are thought to initiate heterochromatin formation in vivo and to propagate a heterochromatic state lasting through several cell divisions. For the present study we analyzed the binding of HP1 to methylated chromatin in a fully reconstituted system. In contrast to its strong binding to methylated peptides, HP1 binds only weakly to methylated chromatin. However, the addition of recombinant SU(VAR) protein, such as ACF1 or SU(VAR)3-9, facilitates HP1 binding to chromatin methylated at lysine 9 within the H3 N terminus (H3K9). We propose that HP1 has multiple target sites that contribute to its recognition of chromatin, only one of them being methylated at H3K9. These findings have implications for the mechanisms of recognition of specific chromatin modifications in vivo.},

Here, we studied autofluorescent protein constructs of the human ISWI family members Snf2H, Snf2L, the catalytically inactive Snf2L+13 splice variant, and the accessory Acf1 subunit in living human and mouse cells by fluorescence microscopy/spectroscopy. Except for Snf2L, which was not detected in the U2OS cell line, the endogenous ISWI proteins were abundant at nuclear concentrations between 0.14 and 0.83 $\mu$M. A protein interaction analysis showed the association of multimeric Snf2H and Acf1 into a heterotetramer or higher-order ACF complex. During the G1/2 cell cycle phase, Snf2H and Snf2L displayed average residence times <150 ms in the chromatin-bound state. The comparison of active and inactive Snf2H/Snf2L indicated that an immobilized fraction potentially involved in active chromatin remodeling comprised only 1-3\%. This fraction was largely increased at replication foci in S phase or at DNA repair sites. To rationalize these findings we propose that ISWI remodelers operate via a "continuous sampling" mechanism: The propensity of nucleosomes to be translocated is continuously tested in transient binding reactions. Most of these encounters are unproductive and efficient remodeling requires an increased binding affinity to chromatin. Due to the relatively high intranuclear remodeler concentrations cellular response times for repositioning a given nucleosome were calculated to be in the range of tens of seconds to minutes.},

abstract = {Chromatin remodelers translocate nucleosomes along the DNA chain in an ATP-dependent manner. This catalytic activity is particularly important for DNA replication and repair since both processes require a significant amount of nucleosome translocations and assembly during DNA synthesis. Recently, we have studied the mobility and interactions of the human ISWI family chromatin remodelers Snf2H and Snf2L as well as Acf1, one of the non-catalytic subunits present in the ACF and CHRAC complexes of Snf2H. We proposed that these protein complexes identify their nucleosomal substrates via a continuous sampling mechanism. It rationalizes the relatively high nuclear mobility and abundance observed for all ISWI proteins in terms of fast target location. According to our model a certain type of ISWI complex visits a given nucleosome in the human genome on the timescale of several seconds to a few minutes. Here, we show that the ISWI proteins Snf2H, Snf2L as well as Acf1 accumulate at UV-induced DNA damage sites within tens of seconds and reach a plateau after a few minutes. These findings corroborate the predictions of the continuous sampling mechanism as an efficient way for targeting chromatin remodelers to sites in the genome that require their activity. In comparison to the mobility of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) that also accumulates at DNA repair sites the specifics of substrate location by chromatin remodelers are further characterized.},

abstract = {We investigated the contribution of the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) gene to DNA repair. We stably transfected XPC cells (XP4PA-SV-EB) with XPC cDNA and selected a partially corrected (XP4PA-SE1) and a fully corrected (XP4PA-SE2) clone. Cell survival after UVC (254 nm) exposure was low for XP4PA-SV-EB, intermediate for XP4PA-SE1, and normal for XP4PA-SE2 cells. XP4PA-SV-EB cells had undetectable XPC mRNA and protein levels. XP4PA-SE1 cells had 130\% of normal mRNA but 25\% of normal protein levels, whereas XP4PA-SE2 cells had an 18-fold mRNA overexpression and normal XPC protein levels compared with normal cells. We measured cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PP) by using specific mAbs and the ELISA technique. XP4PA-SV-EB cells had no detectable removal of CPD or 6-4PP from their global genome by 24 h after 30 J/m(2) UVC exposure. The partially corrected XP4PA-SE1 cells had normal repair of CPD but minimal repair of 6-4PP by 24 h, whereas the fully corrected XP4PA-SE2 cells regained normal CPD and 6-4PP repair capacities. We also exposed pRSVcat plasmid to UVC (to induce CPD and 6-4PP), to UVC + photolyase (to leave only 6-4PP on the plasmid), or to UVB + acetophenone (to induce only CPD). Host cell reactivation of UVB + acetophenone-, but not of UVC + photolyase-treated plasmids was normal in XP4PA-SE1 cells. Thus, increasing XPC gene expression leads to selective repair of CPD in the global genome. Undetectable XPC protein is associated with no repair of CPD or 6-4PP, detectable but subnormal XPC protein levels reconstitute CPD but not 6-4PP repair, and normal XPC protein levels fully reconstitute both CPD and 6-4PP repair.},

abstract = {Restarting stalled replication forks is vital to avoid fatal replication errors. Previously, it was demonstrated that hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks rescue replication either by an active restart mechanism or by new origin firing. To our surprise, using the DNA fibre assay, we only detect a slightly reduced fork speed on a UV-damaged template during the first hour after UV exposure, and no evidence for persistent replication fork arrest. Interestingly, no evidence for persistent UV-induced fork stalling was observed even in translesion synthesis defective, Pol$\eta$(mut) cells. In contrast, using an assay to measure DNA molecule elongation at the fork, we observe that continuous DNA elongation is severely blocked by UV irradiation, particularly in UV-damaged Pol$\eta$(mut) cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that UV-blocked replication forks restart effectively through re-priming past the lesion, leaving only a small gap opposite the lesion. This allows continuation of replication on damaged DNA. If left unfilled, the gaps may collapse into DNA double-strand breaks that are repaired by a recombination pathway, similar to the fate of replication forks collapsed after hydroxyurea treatment.},

abstract = {Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) encodes the viral protein Tax, which is believed to act as a viral transactivator through its interactions with a variety of transcription factors, including CREB and NF-kappaB. As is the case for all retroviruses, the provirus is inserted into the host DNA, where nucleosomes are deposited to ensure efficient packaging. Nucleosomes act as roadblocks in transcription, making it difficult for RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to proceed toward the 3' end of the genome. Because of this, a variety of chromatin remodelers can act to modify nucleosomes, allowing for efficient transcription. While a number of covalent modifications are known to occur on histone tails in HTLV-1 infection (i.e., histone acetyltransferases [HATs], histone deacetylases [HDACs], and histone methyltransferases [HMTs]), evidence points to the use of chromatin remodelers that use energy from ATP hydrolysis to remodel nucleosomes. Here we confirm that BRG1, which is the core subunit of eight chromatin-remodeling complexes, is essential not only for Tax transactivation but also for viral replication. This is especially evident when wild-type infectious clones of HTLV-1 are used. BRG1 associates with Tax at the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and coexpression of BRG1 and Tax results in increased rates of transcription. The interaction of BRG1 with Tax additionally recruits the basal transcriptional machinery and removes some of the core histones from the nucleosome at the start site (Nuc 1). When using the BRG1-deficient cell lines SW13, C33A, and TSUPR1, we observed little viral transcription and no viral replication. Importantly, while these three cell lines do not express detectable levels of BRG1, much of the SWI/SNF complex remains assembled in the cells. Knockdown of BRG1 and associated SWI/SNF subunits suggests that the BRG1-utilizing SWI/SNF complex PBAF is responsible for HTLV-1 nucleosome remodeling. Finally, HTLV-1 infection of cell lines with a knockdown in BRG1 or the PBAF complex results in a significant reduction in viral production. Overall, we concluded that BRG1 is required for Tax transactivation and HTLV-1 viral production and that the PBAF complex appears to be responsible for nucleosome remodeling.},

of TFIIH is the excision-repair protein XPB/ERCC3 (ref. 1), a helicase
implicated in the human DNA-repair disorders xeroderma pigmentosum

transcription and DNA repair. To understand the connection between
these two cellular processes, we have extensively purified and functionally
analysed TFIIH. We find that TFIIH has a dual role, being required
for basal transcription of class II genes and for participation in
DNA-excision repair. TFIIH is shown to complement three different
cell extracts deficient in excision repair: XPB/ERCC3, XPC and XPD/ERCC2.
The complementation of XPB and XPD is a consequence of ERCC3 and
ERCC2 being integral subunits of TFIIH, whereas complementation of
XPC is due to an association of this polypeptide with TFIIH. We found
that the general transcription factor IIE negatively modulates the
helicase activity of TFIIH through a direct interaction between TFIIE

abstract = {The replication protein A complex (RPA) plays a crucial role in DNA replication and damage response. However, it is not known whether this complex is regulated by the SUMOylation pathway. Here, we show that the 70 kDa subunit of RPA (RPA70) associates with a Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease, SENP6, in the nucleus to maintain RPA70 in a hypoSUMOylated state during S phase. Campothecin (CPT), an inducer of replication stress, dissociates SENP6 from RPA70, allowing RPA70 to be modified by a small ubiquitin-like modifier 2/3 (SUMO-2/3). RPA70 SUMOylation facilitates recruitment of Rad51 to the DNA damage foci to initiate DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR). Cell lines that expressed a RPA70 mutant that cannot be SUMOylated are defective in HR and have a marked increase in sensitivity to CPT. These results demonstrate that SUMOylation status of RPA70 plays a critical role in the regulation of DNA repair through homologous recombination.},

particular distortions of the double helix, induced by a damaged
nucleotide, provide the molecular determinants not only for lesion
recognition but also for subsequent verification or demarcation processes.
Here, we discuss the evidence in support of a bipartite mechanism
of substrate discrimination that is initiated by the detection of
thermodynamically unstable base pairs followed by direct localization
of the lesion through an enzymatic proofreading activity. This bipartite
discrimination mechanism is part of a dynamic reaction cycle that
confers high levels of selectivity to avoid futile repair events

A wide variety of damage was detected with the first two methods, including pyrimidine dimers and single- and double-strand breaks.

repair of interstrand DNA cross-links and, by analogy to the homologous
Rad1-Rad10 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in recombination
between direct repeated DNA sequences. To gain insight into the role
of ERCC1-XPF in such recombinational processes and in the NER reaction,
we studied in detail the DNA structural elements required for ERCC1-XPF
endonucleolytic activity. Recombinant ERCC1-XPF, purified from insect
cells, was found to cleave stem-loop substrates at the DNA junction
in the absence of other proteins like replication protein A, showing
that the structure-specific endonuclease activity is intrinsic to
the complex. Cleavage depended on the presence of divalent cations
and was optimal in low Mn2+ concentrations (0.2 mM). A minimum of
4-8 unpaired nucleotides was required for incisions by ERCC1-XPF.
Splayed arm and flap substrates were also cut by ERCC1-XPF, resulting
in the removal of 3' protruding single-stranded arms. All incisions
occurred in one strand of duplex DNA at the 5' side of a junction

2 to 8 nucleotides away from the junction. One single-stranded arm,

abstract = {DDB has been implicated in DNA repair as well as transcription. Mutations in DDB have been correlated with the repair-deficiency disease, xeroderma pigmentosum group E (XP-E). The XP-E cells exhibit deficiencies in global genomic repair, suggesting a role for DDB in that process. DDB also possesses a transcription stimulatory activity. We showed that DDB could function as a transcriptional partner of E2F1. But the mechanism by which DDB stimulates E2F-regulated transcription or carry out its DNA repair function is not understood. To investigate the mechanisms, we looked for nuclear proteins that interact with DDB. Here we show that DDB associates with the CBP/p300 family of proteins, in vivo and in vitro. We suggest that DDB participates in global genomic repair by recruiting CBP/p300 to the damaged-chromatin. It is possible that the histone acetyltransferase activities of the CBP/p300 proteins induce chromatin remodeling at the damaged-sites to allow recruitment of the repair complexes. The observation offers insights into both transcription and repair functions of DDB.},

Rad23, which was originally identified as an important factor involved in the recognition of DNA lesions, also plays a central role in targeting ubiquitylated proteins for proteasomal degradation, an activity that it shares with other ubiquitin receptors like Dsk2 and Ddi1. Although the finding that Rad23 serves as a ubiquitin receptor explains to a large extent its importance in proteasomal degradation, the precise mode of action of Rad23 in NER and the possible link with the UPS is less clear. In this review, we discuss our present knowledge on the functions of Rad23 in protein degradation and DNA repair and speculate on the importance of the dual roles of Rad23 for the cell's ability to cope with stress conditions.},

Convergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility.

Ionizing radiation (IR) mediated activation of the DDR induces a transcriptional upregulation of genes that are also involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). This suggests that pre-exposure to X-rays might stimulate NER in human cells. Here, we demonstrate in normal human fibroblasts that UV-induced NER is augmented by pre-exposure to IR and that this increased repair is accompanied by elevated mRNA and protein levels of the NER factors XPC and DDB2. Furthermore, when IR exposure precedes local UV irradiation, the presence of XPC and DDB2 at the sites of local UV damages is increased. This increase might be p53 dependent, but the mechanism of X-ray specific stabilization of p53 is unclear as both X-rays and UV stabilize p53.},

of the genetic material. Dissection of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA
replication has resulted in the identification of many eukaryotic
replication proteins, but the biochemistry of the multienzyme process

absolutely required for semiconservative replication of SV40 DNA
in vitro is human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB, also
called RF-A and RP-A). SSB consists of three polypeptides of relative
molecular mass 70,000, 34,000 and 13,000, and acts with T antigen
and topoisomerases to unwind DNA, allowing the access of other replication
proteins. Human SSB can also stimulate the activity of polymerases
alpha and delta, suggesting a further role in elongation during DNA
replication. We have now found a role for human SSB in DNA excision
repair using a cell-free system that can carry out nucleotide excision
repair in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies against human SSB caused extensive
inhibition of DNA repair in plasmid molecules damaged by ultraviolet
light or acetylaminofluorene. Addition of purified SSB reversed this
inhibition and further stimulated repair synthesis by increasing
the number of repair events. These results show that a mammalian

@article{Coulon2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene promoters can be in various epigenetic states and undergo interactions with many molecules in a highly transient, probabilistic and combinatorial way, resulting in a complex global dynamics as observed experimentally. However, models of stochastic gene expression commonly consider promoter activity as a two-state on/off system. We consider here a model of single-gene stochastic expression that can represent arbitrary prokaryotic or eukaryotic promoters, based on the combinatorial interplay between molecules and epigenetic factors, including energy-dependent remodeling and enzymatic activities.

RESULTS: We show that, considering the mere molecular interplay at the promoter, a single-gene can demonstrate an elaborate spontaneous stochastic activity (eg. multi-periodic multi-relaxation dynamics), similar to what is known to occur at the gene-network level. Characterizing this generic model with indicators of dynamic and steady-state properties (including power spectra and distributions), we reveal the potential activity of any promoter and its influence on gene expression. In particular, we can reproduce, based on biologically relevant mechanisms, the strongly periodic patterns of promoter occupancy by transcription factors (TF) and chromatin remodeling as observed experimentally on eukaryotic promoters. Moreover, we link several of its characteristics to properties of the underlying biochemical system. The model can also be used to identify behaviors of interest (eg. stochasticity induced by high TF concentration) on minimal systems and to test their relevance in larger and more realistic systems. We finally show that TF concentrations can regulate many aspects of the stochastic activity with a considerable flexibility and complexity.

CONCLUSIONS: This tight promoter-mediated control of stochasticity may constitute a powerful asset for the cell. Remarkably, a strongly periodic activity that demonstrates a complex TF concentration-dependent control is obtained when molecular interactions have typical characteristics observed on eukaryotic promoters (high mobility, functional redundancy, many alternate states/pathways). We also show that this regime results in a direct and indirect energetic cost. Finally, this model can constitute a framework for unifying various experimental approaches. Collectively, our results show that a gene - the basic building block of complex regulatory networks - can itself demonstrate a significantly complex behavior.},

abstract = {The recognition and subsequent repair of DNA damage are essential reactions for the maintenance of genome stability. A key general sensor of DNA lesions is xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein, which recognizes a wide variety of helix-distorting DNA adducts arising from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, genotoxic chemicals and reactive metabolic byproducts. By detecting damaged DNA sites, this unique molecular sensor initiates the global genome repair (GGR) pathway, which allows for the removal of all the aforementioned lesions by a limited repertoire of excision factors. A faulty GGR activity causes the accumulation of DNA adducts leading to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, neurological degeneration and other traits of premature aging. Recent findings indicate that XPC protein achieves its extraordinary substrate versatility by an entirely indirect readout strategy implemented in two clearly discernible stages. First, the XPC subunit uses a dynamic sensor interface to monitor the double helix for the presence of non-hydrogen-bonded bases. This initial screening generates a transient nucleoprotein intermediate that subsequently matures into the ultimate recognition complex by trapping undamaged nucleotides in the abnormally oscillating native strand, in a way that no direct contacts are made between XPC protein and the offending lesion itself. It remains to be elucidated how accessory factors like Rad23B, centrin-2 or the UV-damaged DNA-binding complex contribute to this dynamic two-stage quality control process.},

abstract = {Initiation of DNA replication and chain growth, analyzed by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation, was interrupted to different extents in different cell types by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Within the first hour of irradiation DNA replication was reduced in a manner that depended on the average number of lesions per replicating unit (replicon). At low numbers of lesions per replicon, inhibition of replicon initiation was the predominant response; at higher numbers of lesions per replicon, blockage of chain growth was also observed. After irradiation with a dose that initially blocked chain growth, the rate at which cells recovered their ability to synthesize increasingly more and larger size DNA was a function both of replicon size and of excision repair capacity. Cells with small replicons recovered more rapidly than cells with large replicons, and excision repair-deficient cells recovered less rapidly than excision-competent cells. These observations indicate that excision repair capacity and replicon size play major roles in the response of DNA replication to ultraviolet damage.},

abstract = {Chromatin is a highly regulated nucleoprotein complex through which genetic material is structured and maneuvered to elicit cellular processes, including transcription, cell division, differentiation, and DNA repair. In eukaryotes, the core of this structure is composed of nucleosomes, or repetitive histone octamer units typically enfolded by 147 base pairs of DNA. DNA is arranged and indexed through these nucleosomal structures to adjust local chromatin compaction and accessibility. Histones are subject to multiple covalent posttranslational modifications, some of which alter intrinsic chromatin properties, others of which present or hinder binding modules for non-histone, chromatin-modifying complexes. Although certain histone marks correlate with different biological outputs, we have yet to fully appreciate their effects on transcription and other cellular processes. Tremendous advancements over the past years have uncovered intriguing histone-related matters and raised important related questions. This review revisits past breakthroughs and discusses novel developments that pertain to histone posttranslational modifications and the affects they have on transcription and DNA packaging.},

amino acid side chains. Here, the molecular function of these closely
spaced electropositive residues has been tested by systematic site-directed
mutagenesis. After the introduction of single amino acid substitutions,
the mutants were probed for protein-DNA interactions in electrophoretic
mobility shift and photochemical crosslinking assays. This analysis
led to the identification of a critical hot-spot for DNA substrate
recognition composed of two neighboring lysines at codons 141 and
179 of the human XPA sequence. The replacement of other basic side
chains in the DNA interaction domain conferred more moderate defects
of substrate binding. When the function of XPA was tested as a fusion
product with either mCherry or green-fluorescent protein, a glutamate
substitution of one of the positively charged residues at positions
141 and 179 was sufficient to decrease DNA repair activity in human
fibroblasts. Thus, the removal of a single cationic side chain abolished
DNA-binding activity and significant excision repair defects could
be induced by single charge inversions on the XPA surface, indicating
that this molecular sensor participates in substrate recognition
by monitoring the electrostatic potential of distorted DNA repair
sites.},

abstract = {The role of chromatin-dependent regulatory mechanisms in the repression of glucocorticoid-dependent transcription from the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter by p65 and E1A was investigated by using chromatin and transiently transfected reporters. The p65 RelA subunit of NF-kappaB represses MMTV expression on either transient or integrated reporters. In contrast, the viral oncoprotein E1A represses a transient but not an integrated MMTV. E1A repression is attenuated by chromatin, suggesting p65 but not E1A manipulates chromatin appropriately to inhibit the GR. Coexpression of p65 and E1A additively represses the transient MMTV but restores the transcriptional activation of the chromatin MMTV in response to glucocorticoids. This indicates that E1A has a dominant chromatin-dependent activity that attenuates repression by p65. E1A, p65, and GR bind the MMTV promoter, and chromatin remodeling enhances binding on both repressed and activated promoters. In addition, p65 requires Brg for repression of the integrated MMTV. This suggests that neither p65 repression nor E1A attenuation of repression results from an inhibition of remodeling that prevents transcription factor binding. Furthermore, p300/CBP is also required for both repression and attenuation by p65 and E1A. E1A and p65 mutants that do not bind p300/CBP are inactive, indicative of a requirement for p300/CBP-dependent complex formation for both repression and attenuation with chromatin. These data suggest that both the p65-dependent repression and the E1A-mediated attenuation of repression require the Brg1-dependent chromatin remodeling function and p300/CBP-dependent complex formation at a promoter assembled within chromatin.},

In an effort to understand substrate determinants of this repair system, we tested DNAs with minor backbone modifications using the ultrasensitive excision assay. We found that a phosphorothioate and a methylphosphonate were excised with low efficiency. Surprisingly, we also found that fragments of 23-28 nucleotides and of 12-13 nucleotides characteristic of human and Escherichia coli excision repair, respectively, were removed from undamaged DNA at a significant rate. Considering the relative abundance of undamaged DNA in comparison to damaged DNA in the course of the life of an organism, we conclude that, in general, excision from and resynthesis of undamaged DNA may exceed the excision and resynthesis caused by DNA damage. As resynthesis is invariably associated with mutations, we propose that gratuitous repair may be an important source of spontaneous mutations.},

However, the kinetic properties of NF-kappaB interaction with cognate sites in vivo are unknown. Here, we show that in living cells NF-kappaB is immobilized onto high-affinity binding sites only transiently, and that complete NF-kappaB turnover on active chromatin occurs in less than 30 s. Therefore, promoter-bound NF-kappaB is in dynamic equilibrium with nucleoplasmic dimers; promoter occupancy and transcriptional activity oscillate synchronously with nucleoplasmic NF-kappaB and independently of promoter occupancy by other sequence-specific transcription factors. These data indicate that changes in the nuclear concentration of NF-kappaB directly impact on promoter function and that promoters sample nucleoplasmic levels of NF-kappaB over a timescale of seconds, thus rapidly re-tuning their activity. We propose a revision of the enhanceosome concept in this dynamic framework.},

These fluctuations are caused in part by changes in relative expression efficiency and the DNA template amount of the network-coding genes. Gene product levels could potentially be decoupled from these changes via built-in adaptation mechanisms, thereby boosting network reliability. Here, we show that a mechanism based on an incoherent feedforward motif enables adaptive gene expression in mammalian cells. We modeled, synthesized, and tested transcriptional and post-transcriptional incoherent loops and found that in all cases the gene product adapts to changes in DNA template abundance. We also observed that the post-transcriptional form results in superior adaptation behavior, higher absolute expression levels, and lower intrinsic fluctuations. Our results support a previously hypothesized endogenous role in gene dosage compensation for such motifs and suggest that their incorporation in synthetic networks will improve their robustness and reliability.},

protein, is a required factor in eukaryotic DNA replication and DNA
repair systems and has been suggested to function during DNA recombination.
The protein is also a target of interaction for a variety of proteins
that control replication, transcription, and cell growth. To understand
the role of hRPA in these processes, we examined the binding of hRPA
to defined ssDNA molecules. Employing gel shift assays that "titrated"
the length of ssDNA, hRPA was found to form distinct multimeric complexes
that could be detected by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. Within these
complexes, monomers of hRPA utilized a minimum binding site size
on ssDNA of 8 to 10 nucleotides (the hRPA8-10nt complex) and appeared
to bind ssDNA cooperatively. Intriguingly, alteration of gel shift
conditions revealed the formation of a second, distinctly different
complex that bound ssDNA in roughly 30-nucleotide steps (the hRPA30nt
complex), a complex similar to that described by Kim et al. (C. Kim,
R. O. Snyder, and M. S. Wold, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:3050-3059, 1992).
Both the hRPA8-10nt and hRPA30nt complexes can coexist in solution.
We speculate that the role of hRPA in DNA metabolism may be modulated
through the ability of hRPA to bind ssDNA in these two modes.},

unknown how preinitiation complex assembly is coordinated with chromatin

the ordered assembly of Mediator, histone acetyltransferases (HATs),
and GTFs onto immobilized chromatin and naked DNA templates in vitro.
Using purified proteins, we found that the Mediator regulates this
assembly process by binding to p300 and TFIID. An acetyl-CoA-dependent
catalytic switch causes p300 to acetylate chromatin and then dissociate.
Dissociation of p300 enhances TFIID binding and active transcription.
The dissociation is caused by an autoacetylation-induced conformational
change in the catalytic domain of p300. We conclude that autoacetylation-induced
dissociation of p300 acts as a catalytic switch, which allows TFIID
binding and subsequent preinitiation complex assembly.},

We created stable XPA(KD) and XPC(KD) (knockdown) syngeneic cell lines to mimic human cancer-prone syndromes. We also silenced (HSA)KIN17. Several clones displaying undetectable protein levels of XPA, XPC, or (HSA)kin17 were grown for more than 300 days. This stability of gene silencing over several months of culture allows us to assess the specific involvement of these proteins in UVC sensitivity in syngeneic cells. Unlike XPA, (HSA)KIN17, and XPC gene silencing dramatically impeded HeLa cell growth for several weeks after transfection. As expected, XPA(KD) and XPC(KD) HeLa cells were highly UVC sensitive. They presented an impaired unscheduled DNA synthesis after UVC irradiation. Interestingly, XPC(KD) HeLa clones were more sensitive to UVC than their XPA(KD) or KIN17(KD) counterparts. Hygromycin B withdrawal led to the total disappearance of EBV vectors and the resumption of normal XPA or XPC protein levels. Whereas reverted XPA(KD) cells recovered a normal UVC sensitivity, XPC(KD) cells remained highly sensitive, suggestive of irreversible damage following long-term XPC silencing. Our results show that in HeLa cells, (HSA)kin17 participates indirectly in early events following UVC irradiation, and XPC deficiency strongly affects cell physiology and contributes to UVC sensitivity to a greater extent than does XPA. EBV-based siRNA vectors improve the interest of siRNA by permitting long-term gene silencing without the safety concerns inherent in viral-based siRNA vehicles.},

abstract = {Fifty years ago thymine dimer was discovered in the Biochemical and
Biophysical Laboratory of Delft Technological University, The Netherlands,
by one of the authors of this review (Beukers) as the first environmentally
induced DNA lesion. It is one of the photoproducts formed between
adjacent pyrimidine bases in DNA by UV irradiation, currently known
as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) photoproducts.
Major lesions found in DNA after in vitro or in vivo UV irradiation
are the cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer and the thymine-cytosine
(6-4) photoproduct. Even after 50 years the study of photo-induced
DNA lesions is still going on as is illustrated by the hundreds of
papers published every year and the millions hits when browsing the
internet for dimer-related information. Living organisms possess
efficient and different mechanisms to repair detrimental lesions
in their DNA. A unique mechanism to repair CPDs is reversion by either
direct interaction with light of short wavelength or by enzymatic
photoreactivation. Photophysical mechanisms that induce and reverse
molecular bonds in biological macromolecules have been a main focus
of research of the group in Delft in the middle of the last century.
This review describes the break-through results of these studies
which were the result of intense interactions between scientists
in the fields of physics, organic chemistry and biochemistry. Philosophically,
the "view" of the group in Delft was very appealing: since in nature
photolesions are induced in DNA by the sun, how is it possible that
repair of these lesions could be accomplished by the same energy
source. Evolutionary, it is hardly possible to think of a more efficient
repair mechanism.},

abstract = {The human CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cell population is heterogeneous and consists of various subpopulations which remain poorly defined. Anergy and suppression are two main functional characteristics of FOXP3(+)Treg cells. We used the anergic behavior of FOXP3(+)Treg cells for a better discrimination and characterization of such subpopulations. We compared IL-2-expressing with IL-2-non-expressing cells within the memory FOXP3(+) T cell population. In contrast to IL-2-non-expressing FOXP3(+) cells, IL-2-expressing FOXP3(+) cells exhibit intermediate characteristics of Treg and Th cells concerning the Treg cell markers CD25, GITR, and Helios. Besides lower levels of FOXP3, they also have higher levels of the transcription factors NFATc2, c-Fos, NF-$\kappa$Bp65, and c-Jun. An approach combining flow cytometric measurements with statistical interpretation for quantitative transcription factor analysis suggests that the physiological expression levels not only of FOXP3 but also of NFATc2, c-Jun, c-Fos, and NF-$\kappa$Bp65 are limiting for the decision whether IL-2 is expressed or not in activated peripheral human memory FOXP3(+) cells. These findings demonstrate that concomitant high levels of NFATc2, c-Jun, c-Fos, and NF-$\kappa$Bp65 lead in addition to potential IL-2 expression in those FOXP3(+) cells with low levels of FOXP3. We hypothesize that not only the level of FOXP3 expression but also the amounts of the four transcription factors studied represent determining factors for the anergic phenotype of FOXP3(+) Treg cells.},

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) exhibits a half maximal time for fluorescent recovery (tau(R)) of 5 s, reflecting the same rapid exchange as observed for GR. In contrast, the large subunit (RPB1) of RNA polymerase II (pol II) required 13 min for complete fluorescence recovery, consistent with its function as a processive enzyme. We also observe a complex induction profile for the kinetics of GR-stimulated transcription.

abstract = {Bulky cisplatin lesions are repaired primarily by nucleotide excision repair (NER), in which the structure specific endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 is a critical component. It is now known that the XPF-ERCC1 complex has repair functions beyond NER and plays a role in homologous recombination (HR). It has been suggested that expression of ERCC1 correlates with cisplatin drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our study, using NSCLC, ovarian, and breast cancer cells, we show that the XPF-ERCC1 complex is a valid target to increase cisplatin cytotoxicity and efficacy. We targeted XPF-ERCC1 complex by RNA interference and assessed the repair capacity of cisplatin intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks by ELISA and alkaline comet assay, respectively. We also assessed the repair of cisplatin-ICL-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) by monitoring gamma-H2AX focus formation. Interestingly, XPF protein levels were significantly reduced following ERCC1 downregulation, but the converse was not observed. The transcript levels were unaffected suggesting that XPF protein stability is likely affected. The repair of both types of cisplatin-DNA lesions was decreased with downregulation of XPF, ERCC1 or both XPF-ERCC1. The ICL-induced DSBs persist in the absence of XPF-ERCC1. The suppression of the XPF-ERCC1 complex significantly decreases the cellular viability which correlates well with the decrease in DNA repair capacity. A double knockdown of XPF-ERCC1 displays the greatest level of cellular cytotoxicity when compared with XPF or ERCC1 alone. The difference in cytotoxicity observed is likely due to the level of total protein complex remaining. These data demonstrate that XPF-ERCC1 is a valid target to enhance cisplatin efficacy in cancer cells by affecting cisplatin-DNA repair pathways.},

abstract = {In mammalian cells, the core factors involved in the damage recognition
and incision steps of DNA nucleotide excision repair are XPA, TFIIH
complex, XPC-HR23B, replication protein A (RPA), XPG, and ERCC1-XPF.
Many interactions between these components have been detected, using
different physical methods, in human cells and for the homologous
factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several human nucleotide excision
repair (NER) complexes, including a high-molecular-mass repairosome
complex, have been proposed. However, there have been no measurements
of activity of any mammalian NER protein complex isolated under native
conditions. In order to assess relative strengths of interactions
between NER factors, we captured TFIIH from cell extracts with an
anti-cdk7 antibody, retaining TFIIH in active form attached to magnetic
beads. Coimmunoprecipitation of other NER proteins was then monitored
functionally in a reconstituted repair system with purified proteins.
We found that all detectable TFIIH in gently prepared human cell
extracts was present in the intact nine-subunit form. There was no
evidence for a repair complex that contained all of the NER components.
At low ionic strength TFIIH could associate with functional amounts
of each NER factor except RPA. At physiological ionic strength, TFIIH
associated with significant amounts of XPC-HR23B and XPG but not
other repair factors. The strongest interaction was between TFIIH
and XPC-HR23B, indicating a coupled role of these proteins in early
steps of repair. A panel of antibodies was used to estimate that
there are on the order of 10(5) molecules of each core NER factor
per HeLa cell.},

abstract = {We previously constructed the cell-free nucleotide excision repair (NER) assay system with UV-irradiated SV40 minichromosomes to analyze the mechanism of NER reaction on chromatin DNA. Here we investigate the factor that acts especially on nucleosomal DNA during the damage excision reaction, and reconstitute the damage excision reaction on SV40 minichromosomes. NER-proficient HeLa whole cell extracts were fractionated, and the amounts of known NER factors involved in the column fractions were determined by immunoblot analyses. The column fractions were quantitatively and systematically replaced by highly purified NER factors. Finally, damage DNA excision reaction on SV40 minichromosomes was reconstituted with six highly purified NER factors, XPA, XPC-HR23B, XPF-ERCC1, XPG, RPA and TFIIH, as those essential for the reaction with naked DNA. Further analysis showed that the damages on chromosomal DNA were excised as the same efficiency as those on naked DNA for short incubation. At longer incubation time, however, the damage excision efficiency on nucleosomal DNA was decreased whereas naked DNA was still vigorously repaired. These observations suggest that although the six purified NER factors have a potential to eliminate the damage DNA from SV40 minichromosomes, the chromatin structure may still have some repressive effects on NER.},

Defective TCR in humans is associated with Cockayne syndrome (CS), typically caused by defects in either CSA or CSB. Here, we show that CSB contains a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). Cells expressing UBD-less CSB (CSB(del)) have phenotypes similar to those of cells lacking CSB, but these can be suppressed by appending a heterologous UBD, so ubiquitin binding is essential for CSB function. Surprisingly, CSB(del) remains capable of assembling nucleotide excision repair factors and repair synthesis proteins around damage-stalled RNAPII, but such repair complexes fail to excise the lesion. Together, our results indicate an essential role for protein ubiquitylation and CSB's UBD in triggering damage incision during TC-NER and allow us to integrate the function of CSA and CSB in a model for the process.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the principal pathway for counteracting cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of UV irradiation. To provide insight into the in vivo regulation of the DNA damage recognition step of global genome NER (GG-NER), we constructed cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1). DDB1 is a core subunit of a number of cullin 4-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes. UV-activated DDB1-DDB2-CUL4A-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase participates in the initiation of GG-NER and triggers the UV-dependent degradation of its subunit DDB2. We found that DDB1 rapidly accumulates on DNA damage sites. However, its binding to damaged DNA is not static, since DDB1 constantly dissociates from and binds to DNA lesions. DDB2, but not CUL4A, was indispensable for binding of DDB1 to DNA damage sites. The residence time of DDB1 on the damage site is independent of the main damage-recognizing protein of GG-NER, XPC, as well as of UV-induced proteolysis of DDB2. The amount of DDB1 that is temporally immobilized on damaged DNA critically depends on DDB2 levels in the cell. We propose a model in which UV-dependent degradation of DDB2 is important for the release of DDB1 from continuous association to unrepaired DNA and makes DDB1 available for its other DNA damage response functions.},

The chromosome territory-interchromatin compartment (CT-IC) model postulates an IC which expands between chromatin domains both in the interior and the periphery of CT. Other models, however, dispute the existence of the IC and claim that numerous chromatin loops expand between and within CTs. The present study was undertaken to resolve these conflicting views. (1) We demonstrate that most chromatin exists in the form of higher-order chromatin domains with a compaction level at least 10 times above the level of extended 30 nm chromatin fibers. A similar compaction level was obtained in a detailed analysis of a particularly gene-dense chromosome region on HSA 11, which often expanded from its CT as a finger-like chromatin protrusion. (2) We further applied an approach which allows the experimental manipulation of both chromatin condensation and the width of IC channels in a fully reversible manner. These experiments, together with electron microscopic observations, demonstrate the existence of the IC as a dynamic, structurally distinct nuclear compartment, which is functionally linked with the chromatin compartment.},

abstract = {Nucleotide excision repair is the principal way by which human cells
remove UV damage from DNA. Human cell extracts were fractionated
to locate active components, including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)
and ERCC factors. The incision reaction was then reconstituted with
the purified proteins RPA, XPA, TFIIH (containing XPB and XPD), XPC,
UV-DDB, XPG, partially purified ERCC1/XPF complex, and a factor designated
IF7. UV-DDB (related to XPE protein) stimulated repair but was not
essential. ERCC1- and XPF-correcting activity copurified with an
ERCC1-binding polypeptide of 110 kDa that was absent in XP-F cell
extract. Complete repair synthesis was achieved by combining these
factors with DNA polymerase epsilon, RFC, PCNA, and DNA ligase I.
The reconstituted core reaction requires about 30 polypeptides.},
