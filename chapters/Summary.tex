DNA repair is indispensable for the protection of cells against environmental and endogenous damaging agents. This is reflected in an increased susceptibility to cellular ageing and cancer development as a consequence of impaired repair. The repair process is carried out by enzymatic macromolecular complexes assembling at damaged sites on the chromatin fibre. Fluorescence imaging of the individual repair factor dynamics shows a rapid protein exchange at the repair sites, while the overall repair process takes significantly longer. How these fast molecular interactions regulate the emergence of higher-level system-properties, such as the repair rate and its robustness, is poorly understood.\\ 
In this thesis we quantify the relation between the protein dynamics and the resulting functional properties of DNA repair by time-resolved measurements of nucleotide-excision DNA repair (NER) in mammalian cells and mathematical modelling. We find that despite the pathway's molecular complexity, DNA repair follows a slow first-order reaction with a half-time of $\sim$1 hour. To gain functional insights, we developed a mathematical model of the NER pathway and identified its parameters from experimental data. According to our model predictions, repair synthesis is not controlled by a rate-limiting component. Instead, all NER factors collectively control the repair-rate, as indicated by uniformly small response coefficients. Harnessing the natural cell-to-cell variability of protein expression, we provide experimental support for the shared control by the core NER factors XPC, TFIIH, XPA, XPF and RPA. However, quantitatively we found a discrepancy between the measured and predicted mean response coefficients. In search of additional sources contributing to the repair-rate control, we observed that the expression of nuclear NER factors is strongly correlated suggesting a co-regulation of the protein expression. Notably, we were able to resolve the difference between measured and predicted repair-rate response by accounting for the discovered co-regulation. \\ 
These findings portray two complementary modes of robust regulation in DNA repair. Firstly, the repair-rate control is shared among all NER factors, which compensates for fluctuations of the protein concentrations. Secondly, these heterogeneities are contained by the co-regulation of the nuclear NER factor expression itself. Given that all chromatin-associated processes are catalysed by multi-protein complexes that assemble and reversibly bind to chromatin, both mechanisms may also function as widespread modes of robust regulation in transcription.



%provide a rationale for the emergence of slow time scales in chromatin-associated processes from fast molecular steps and suggest that collective rate control might be a widespread mode of robust regulation in DNA repair and transcription.
