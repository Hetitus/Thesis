\chapter{Control analysis of the DNA repair rate}

In the previous chapter we introduced the incorporation of EdU upon UV-irradiation as a quantitative readout for the DNA repair synthesis kinetic (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:EdU_measurement}). We could show that despite the pathway's complexity DNA repair follows a mono-exponential kinetic of first order. Moreover, the repair of single lesions is distributed over a broad time span with 50\% of the lesions being repaired after a half-time of $\sim$1.2 h. Notably, measurements on the single cell level revealed that also the half-time and hence the rate of repair is highly variable (cf. Figure \ref{fig:DNArepairKinetic}B-E). So far the origin of this variability is unknown but also if and how the cell faces this highly fluctuating environment.\\  
In the following chapter we will apply the kinetic NER model and explore the nature of the repair rate variability. Simulating the effect of NER factor variation on the repair rate we find that the repair rate control is distributed among all NER factors. Exploiting the natural variability of expressed repair proteins we can experimentally corroborate the computationally derived finding for the NER factors XPC, TFIIH, XPA, XPF and RPA. Apart from the variability in protein expression the model identifies the initial amount of inflicted DNA damage as major contribution determining the repair rate distribution. Both sources together appear to be sufficient to explain the overall rate variability.     

- clarify who did what...
- what about the response coefficients
- don't forget to explain that TFIIH, RPA and XPF were indirectly antibody labeled

\section{Kinetic NER model predicts collective rate control}

 
\subsection{Response coefficients}

The narrow confidence bounds derived by PLE analysis identified parameters in reasonable biological ranges (cf.\ Section \ref{sec:identifiabilityAnalysis}) and allowed us to use the model for quantitative predictions. On the basis of the simplified model result, indicating that the fast and random enzyme exchange defines the slow first-oder rate kinetics (cf.\ Section \ref{sec:toyModel}), we wanted to test whether the concept of multi-protein rate control also applies on the realistic NER model. To determine the response of a system to changes in the environment one can calculate the response coefficients $\tilde{R}_i$ \cite{Hofmeyr1991,Fell1992}. Accordingly, we can quantify the relative change in the repair rate $\nu$ as a function of the relative change in the protein concentration $C_i$ ($i$ = XPC, TFIIH,...).

\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}_i = \frac{\partial \, \text{ln} \, \nu}{\partial \, \text{ln} \, C_i}.
\label{eqn:responseCoefficients}
\end{equation}

The inverse of $\nu$ is referred to as characteristic time $\tau$ so that Eqn. \ref{eqn:responseCoefficients} can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\tilde{R}_i = \frac{C_i}{\tau^{-1}} \frac{\partial  \, \tau^{-1}}{\partial \,  C_i}.
\label{eqn:rC_characteristicTime}   
\end{equation}

$\tau$, in turn, can be directly approximated from the distribution of repaired DNA states $y^R_\pi(t)$, which include the modeled DNA intermediates for resynthesized and rechromatinized DNA. By taking the ratio between the first ($\mu^{(1)}$) and the zeroth ($\mu^{(0)}$) central moment of the distribution we derive the reaction-specific mean time 

\begin{equation}
\tau_{R} = \frac{\mu{(1)}}{\mu^{(0)}}, 
\label{eqn:meanreactiontime}   
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
\mu^{(m)} = \int t^m \, y^R_\pi(t)\, dt.
\label{eqn:moments}   
\end{equation}


To ensure the convergence of the integral we subtract all repair synthesis states (IV + V) from the initial amount of damages $y^{\text{I}}_{00} = $ 3.33 \textmu M at t = 0.
	
\begin{equation}	
	\tau_{\text{syn}}=\frac{\int (y^I_{00}(0)-( \sum_ \pi  y_\pi^{IV}(t)+\sum_ \pi  y_\pi^{V}(t))\; dt)\cdot t\; dt}{\int y^I_{00}(0)-( \sum_ \pi  y_\pi^{IV}(t)+\sum_ \pi  y_\pi^{V}(t))\; dt}
\end{equation}

Using $\tau_syn$ in Equation \ref{eqn:rC_characteristicTime} we derive the response coefficients for the repair synthesis rate, which are uniformly small $\sim$0.3 and below (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:controlCoefficients}). This result implies that that there is no single repair protein whose effect on the repair speed could be interpreted as rate-limiting. A similar result is obtained for the rate of re-synthesis response coefficients (cf.\ Appendix ), with the characteristic time

\begin{equation}
\tau_{\text{inc}}=\frac{\int^\infty_0 \,t \,\sum_{x=I}^{\text{III}} \sum_ \pi  y_\pi^x(t)\,dt}{\int^\infty_0  \,\sum_{x=I}^{\text{III}} \sum_ \pi  y_\pi^x(t)\,dt}.
\end{equation}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Prediction profile likelihood}
To obtain realistic confidence bounds for the response coefficients we performed a prediction profile likelihood estimation \cite{Kreutz2012,Hinkley1979}. Thereby the predicted response coefficients $\tilde{R} = F(D_{\text{pred}},\theta)$ are considered as model outcome $F$ for a predicted experimental design $D_{\text{pred}}= (z_{\text{pred}},t_{\text{pred}},u_{\text{pred}})$. $D_{\text{pred}}$ specifies a prediction observable $z_{\text{pred}}$ at time point $t_{\text{pred}}$ given the externally controlled stimulation $u_{\text{pred}}$. As defined in Eqn. \ref{eqn:observable} $z_{\text{pred}}(y(t),\theta)$ comprises a model simulation that can be mapped to experimentally observable quantities. Analogous to Eqn. \ref{eqn:PL} the prediction profile likelihood 
\begin{equation}
	PPL(\tilde{R}) = \max_{\theta^\ast \in \{\theta \lvert F(D_{\text{pred}},\theta)=\tilde{R}\}} L(z^\dag \lvert \theta^\ast,\tilde{r}) 
\end{equation}   

is obtained by maximization over the model parameters satisfying the constraint that the model response $F(D, \theta^\ast)$ after fitting is equal to the considered value $\tilde{r}$ for the prediction $\tilde{R}$ with respect to the measured data $z^\dag$. This procedure is repeated for continuous variations of $\tilde{R}$. The model response can then be expressed as 

\begin{equation}
\Delta X_{\theta_l}^2(\tilde{r}) = \min_{\{\theta, \tilde{r} \in \tilde{R}  \}} \left( X^2 (\theta,\tilde{r} )\right)
- \quad  \min_{\{\theta\}} \quad  \left( X^2 (\theta)\right),
\end{equation}

which describes the difference between the global $X^2$ minimum and the best fit with $r$ included into the objective function. Similar to Eqn. \ref{eqn:confidenceIntervals} we can determine prediction confidence bounds 

   \begin{equation}
   PCI_{1-a}(D_{\text{pred}},z^\dag) = \{\tilde{r}\textbar \Delta X_{\theta_l}^2(\tilde{r})\leq Q_{X^2}(1-a,1)\},
   \label{eqn:confidenceIntervalsPPL}
   \end{equation}

which include the set of predictions $\tilde{R} = F(D_{\text{pred}},\theta)$ for which -2log(PPL) is below the threshold given by the $X^2$-distribution. The PPLs were computed within the d2d-framework \cite{Raue2013} using the CVODE package \cite{Hindmarsh2005} for the numerical integration of the ODEs and the sensitivity equations (cf. Section \ref{sec:maximumLL}).
By applying the PPL analysis for each response coefficient we find that all of them have small confidence bounds indicating how well the model predictions are determined by the data (cf. Figure \ref{fig:controlCoefficients}B).\\ The moderate response predicted by the response coefficients also holds true for larger variations in the repair factor concentration (cf. Figure \ref{fig:R_largeProteinVariation}). The linear approximation (on which the response coefficients are based) yields a reasonable description for about two-fold concentration decreases or increases (corresponding to a knockdown or overexpression experiment), while for very large decreases the repair rate drops eventually to zero (corresponding essentially to a gene knockout). From this result we can conclude that kinetic NER model predicts a collectively NER factor control of the repair rate. Consequently, the repair pathway appears robust against natural fluctuations in repair protein expression.

\subsection{Exploiting natural variability in protein expression to quantify rate control}
\label{natural_Variability_m}
To corroborate the model prediction of a distributed repair rate control, we developed an experimental setup for the investigation of single repair factors and their quantitative influence on the repair rate. In particular, we asked whether there is a measurable response in the repair rate due to the natural occurring variability in protein expression. By capturing the integrated nuclear fluorescence intensity of antibody-stained repair proteins we derived the expression values for XPC, TFIIH, XPA, XPF and RPA. (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:accuImage}B). For these five individually measured NER factors the expression variability was quantified by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation divided by the mean), which was on average $\sim$0.37 (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:ProteinDist}A-E). Table \ref{tab:proteinVariability} depicts mean and standard deviation representing at least three biologically independent measurements of the expressed protein cell-two-cell variability.

Within each measurement between n=250 and n=572 with an average of n=477 cells were analyzed.}\label{tab:proteinVariability}
\end{table}      

To distinguish whether the measured variability is due to differences in nuclear expression or rather superimposed by measurement noise we co-analyzed XPC-eGFP stably expressed in XP-C fibroblasts together with immunofluorescently labeled XPC in the same cell. Both quantities are strong positively correlated (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:ProteinDist}F) suggesting a large natural variability compared to much lower measurement noise. To quantitatively validate this observation we performed a principal component analysis \cite{Pearson1901}. Thereby both quantities, XPC-eGFP and antibody-stained XPC intensities, are orthogonally transformed into a new coordinate system were the new transformed variables are linearly uncorrelated. These new variables are referred to as principal components. In a two-dimensional case the variances of both principal components define an error-ellipse as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ProteinDist}F. From this we estimated a relative measurement error of antibody labeling of $\sim$11\% showing that the technique is suitable for quantification of nuclear XPC, TFIIH, XPA, XPF and RPA concentrations.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Before exploring the direct relation between protein expression variability and the speed of repair we tested whether higher protein amounts in the nucleus correlate with the accumulation of NER factors in the locally damaged area. In correspondence to previous findings for XPG \cite{Luijsterburg2010} there is a significant positive correlation between the nuclear XPC-eGFP expression and its local accumulation at the DNA lesions (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:Nuc_vs_DNAsynthesis}A) thirty minutes after UV irradiation. The same holds true for XPA \cite{Verbruggen2014}, TFIIH, XPF and RPA in narrow confidence bounds (cf.\ Appendix \textbf{tbm}). Consequently, we conclude that the DNA lesions are not saturated so that a higher NER factor concentration could potentially accelerate the repair rate.\\
In fact, the nuclear protein concentrations for all five antibody-stained repair factors and the amount of incorporated EdU after one hour were significantly correlated (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:Nuc_vs_DNAsynthesis}B-F). Remarkably, the dependency between both quantities, characterized by the slope of the regression line is very evenly distributed and also in the same order of magnitude as predicted computationally by the response coefficients (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:controlCoefficients}A). Nevertheless, all measure responses are consistently two to four-fold larger than the predicted response coefficients. This agrees on one hand with the \textit{in silico} finding that the kinetic control of the measured repair factors is uniformly distributed and that the rate of repair synthesis is robust against natural variations in the repair protein expression. On the other hand this result suggests that the measured repair rate response is not entirely explained solely by the model-predicted response coefficients. It remains to clarify, whether this discrepancy is due to a so far unknown additional NER component intrinsically contributing to the pathway control. Or, if there is an external element coordinating the NER factor expression and thereby superimposing the mathematically predicted response coefficients.

\paragraph{Correlation analysis}
The correlation analysis was performed in MATLAB (2012a, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) using the inbuilt corrcoef function, which also returns p-values indicating the significance of the correlation coefficient. The p-values are determined by a t-test, where the null-hypothesis states that the true correlation between two variables equals zero and that for its observed value $r$ the quantity 
\begin{equation}
	t = \frac{r}{\sqrt{\frac{(1-r^2)}{N-2}}}
\end{equation}     
follows approximately a $t$-distribution for $N-2$ degrees of freedom and a sample size $N$ \cite{Kendall1979,Fisher1958}. A low p-value suggests the rejection of the null-hypothesis and thus, demonstrates the significance of the correlation.\\
The confidence intervals for each correlation coefficient were estimated by non-parametric bootstrap \cite{Efron1979}. Thereby the correlation coefficient was re-sampled for 10,000 times each time drawing n pseudoreplicates (with replacement), where n denotes the number of measured cells from the original data. The confidence borders mark the interval including 95\% of the re-sampled correlation coefficients.
