  abstract = {Fractionation of extracts from human cell lines allows nucleotide
	excision repair of damaged DNA to be resolved into discrete incision
	and polymerization stages. Generation of incised intermediates depends
	on the XP-A protein, a polypeptide that recognizes sites of damaged
	DNA, and on the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein HSSB. The
	proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for the DNA
	synthesis that converts the nicked intermediates to completed repair
	events. This need for PCNA implies that repair synthesis is carried
	out by DNA polymerase delta or epsilon. The ability to visualize
	repair intermediates in the absence of PCNA facilitates dissection
	of the multiprotein reaction that leads to incision of damaged DNA
	in a major pathway of cellular defense against mutagens.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, nucleotide excision repair of DNA is a complex process
	that requires many polypeptides to perform dual incision and remove
	a segment of about 30 nucleotides containing the damage, followed
	by repair DNA synthesis to replace the excised segment. Nucleotide
	excision repair DNA synthesis is dependent on proliferating cell
	nuclear antigen (PCNA). To study gap-filling DNA synthesis during
	DNA nucleotide excision repair, UV-damaged DNA was first incubated
	with PCNA-depleted human cell extracts to create repair incisions.
	Purified DNA polymerase delta or epsilon, with DNA ligase, was then
	used to form the repair patch. DNA polymerase delta could perform
	repair synthesis and was strictly dependent on the presence of both
	PCNA and replication factor C, but gave rise to a very low proportion
	of complete, ligated circles. The presence of replication protein
	A (which is also required for nucleotide excision repair) did not
	alter this result, while addition of DNase IV increased the fraction
	of ligated products. DNA polymerase epsilon, on the other hand, could
	fill the repair patch in the absence of PCNA and replication factor
	C, and most of the products were ligated circles. Addition of replication
	protein A changed the situation dramatically, and synthesis by polymerase
	epsilon became dependent on both PCNA and replication factor C. A
	combination of DNA polymerase epsilon, PCNA, replication factor C,
	replication protein A, and DNA ligase I appears to be well-suited
	to the task of creating nucleotide excision repair patches.},
