  Abstract                 = {{P}lasmacytoid dendritic cells (p{DC}s) recognize {RNA} virus infection via {TLR}s and consequently produce vast amounts of type {I} {IFN}. {B}ecause nucleic acid-sensing {TLR}s reside in the intracellular membrane compartment, it is presumable that p{DC}s do not require cytoplasmic viral replication to recognize the infection. {B}y checking {N}ewcastle disease virus ({NDV}) {RNA} abundance in {GFP}(+) and {GFP}(-) p{DC}s from {I}fna6gfp mice, we found that {NDV} replication was not detected in {IFN}-producing p{DC}s. {GFP}(+) p{DC} was induced in response to replication-incompetent {NDV}. {I}n contrast, the replication-incompetent {NDV} failed to induce {IFN}-producing p{DC}s in type {I} {IFNR}-deficient mice. {T}he lack of {IFNR} signaling led to the replication of {NDV} and the subsequent {RIG}-{I}-like helicase-dependent {IFN}-alpha production in p{DC}s. {T}hese results showed that detection of viruses via {TLR}s together with a type {I} {IFN} feedback system circumvents the requirement for viral replication-dependent recognition in p{DC}s.},
